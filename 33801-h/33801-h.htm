<h2>THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS.</h2>



<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h5>THE BALL.</h5>


<p>Belonging to one of the first families in France, still
young, and with a face that would have been agreeable
had it not been for the almost ridiculous and disproportionate
length of his nose, M. de Lucenay joined to a
restless love of constant motion the habit of talking and
laughing fearfully loud upon subjects quite at variance
with good taste or polished manners, and throwing himself
into attitudes so abrupt and awkward that it was
only by recalling who he was, that his being found in
the midst of the most distinguished societies in Paris
could be accounted for, or a reason assigned for tolerating
his gestures and language; for both of which he had
now, by dint of long practice and adherence, acquired a
sort of free license or impunity. He was shunned like
the plague, although not deficient in a certain description
of wit, which told here and there amid the indescribable
confusion of remarkable phraseology which he
allowed himself the use of; in fact, he was one of those
unintentional instruments of vengeance one would always
like to employ in the wholesale chastisement of persons
who have rendered themselves either ridiculous
or abhorrent.</p>

<p>The Duchess de Lucenay, one of the most agreeable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and, at the same time, most fashionable women in Paris
(spite of her having numbered thirty summers), had
more than once furnished matter of conversation among
the scandal-dealers of Paris; but her errors, whatever
they were supposed to be, were pardoned, in consideration
of the heavy drawback of such a partner as M. de
Lucenay.</p>

<p>Another feature in the character of this latter-named
individual was a singular affectation of the most absurd
and unknown expressions, relative to imaginary complaints
and ridiculous infirmities he amused himself in
supposing you suffered from, and concerning which he
would make earnest inquiries, in a loud voice, and in the
immediate presence of a hundred persons. But possessed
of first-rate courage, and always ready to take the consequences
of his disagreeable jokes, M. de Lucenay had
been concerned in various affairs of honour arising out
of them, with varied success; coming off sometimes
victor, sometimes vanquished, without being in any way
cured of his unpleasant and annoying tricks.</p>

<p>All this premised, we will ask the reader to imagine
the loud, harsh voice of the personage we have been
describing, shouting from the distance at which he first
recognised Madame d'Harville and Sarah:</p>

<p>"Holla! holla! who is that out there? Come, who is
it? Let's see. What! the prettiest woman at the ball
sitting out here, away from everybody! I can't have
this; it is high time I returned from the other end of
the world to put a stop to such doings as this. I tell
you what, marquise, if you persist in thus concealing
yourself from general view, and cheating people from
looking at you, I will set up a cry of fire! fire! that
shall bring every one out of the ballroom, around you."</p>

<p>And then, by way of terminating his discourse, M. de
Lucenay threw himself almost on his back beside the
two ladies, crossed his left leg over his right thigh, and
held his foot in his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have soon returned from Constantinople, my
lord," observed Madame d'Harville, fancying it was
necessary to say something, and, at the same time,
drawing away from her unpleasant neighbour with ill-concealed
impatience.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is just what my wife said! 'Already back,
my lord?' exclaimed she, when she saw me alight from
my travelling-carriage; 'Why, bless me, I did not expect
you so soon!' And, do you know, instead of flying to
my arms, as if the surprise had delighted her, she turned
quite sulky, and refused to appear with me at this, my
first ball since my return! And, upon my soul, I declare
her staying away has caused a far greater sensation
than my presence,&mdash;droll, isn't it? 'Pon my life, I
declare I can't make it out. When she is with me,
nobody pays the least attention to me; but when I
entered the room alone to-night, such a crowd came humming
and buzzing around me, all calling out at once,
'Where is Madame de Lucenay? Is not she coming this
evening? Oh, dear, what a disappointment! How vexatious!
How disagreeable!' etc., etc. And then, marquise,
when I come where you are, and expect, after
returning all the way from Constantinople, you will be
overjoyed to see me, you look upon me as if I were a
dog running amidst an interesting game of ninepins;
and yet, for all I see, I am just as agreeable as other
people."</p>

<p>"And it would have been so easy for you to have
continued agreeable&mdash;in the East," added Madame
d'Harville, slightly smiling.</p>

<p>"Stop abroad, you mean, I suppose; yes, I dare say.
I tell you I could not, and I would not; and it is not
quite what I like, to hear you say so!" exclaimed M. de
Lucenay, uncrossing his legs, and beating the crown of
his hat after the fashion of a tambourine.</p>

<p>"Well, for heaven's sake, my lord, be still, and do
not call out so very loudly," said Madame d'Harville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
angrily, "or really you will compel me to change my
place."</p>

<p>"Change your place! Ah, to be sure! You want to
take my arm, and walk about the gallery a little; come
along, then, I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Walk with you! Certainly not! And pray let me
beg of you not to meddle with that bouquet&mdash;and have
the goodness not to touch the fan either; you will only
break it, as you always do."</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you! talking of breaking fans, I am unlucky.
Did my wife ever show you a magnificent
Chinese fan, given to her by Madame de Vaudémont?
Well, I broke that!" And, having delivered himself of
these comforting words, M. de Lucenay again threw
himself back on the divan he had been lounging on, but,
with his accustomed gaucherie, contrived to pitch himself
over the back of it, on to the ground, grasping in his
hand a quantity of the floating wreaths of climbing
plants which depended from the boughs of the trees
under which the party was sitting, and which he had
been, for some time, amusing himself with essaying to
catch, as, moved by the light breeze admitted into the
place, they undulated gracefully over his head. The
suddenness of his fall brought down, not only those he
held, but the parent stems belonging to them; and poor
De Lucenay was so covered by the mass of foliage thus
unexpectedly obtained, that, ere he could thoroughly disengage
himself from their circling tendrils, he presented
the appearance of some monarch of May-day crowned
with his leafy diadem. So whimsical an appearance as
he presented drew down roars of deafening, stunning
laughter; much to the annoyance of Madame d'Harville,
who would quickly have got out of the vicinity of so
awkward and unpleasant a person had she not perceived
M. Charles Robert (the commandant of Madame Pipelet's
accounts) advancing from the other end of the gallery;
and, unwilling to appear as though going to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
him, she once more resumed her seat beside M. de
Lucenay.</p>

<p>"I say, Lady Macgregor," vociferated the incorrigible
De Lucenay, "didn't I look preciously like a wild man
of the woods, or the god Pan, or a sylvan, or a naiad,
or some of those savage creatures, with that green wreath
round my head? Oh, but talking of savages," added he,
abruptly approaching Sarah, "Lady Macgregor, I must
tell you a most outrageously indecent story. Just imagine
that at Otaheite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lord duke&mdash;" interrupted Sarah, in a tone of
freezing rebuke.</p>

<p>"Just as you like,&mdash;you are not obliged to hear my
story if you don't like it; you are the loser, that's all.
Ah! I see Madame de Fonbonne out there; I shall keep
it for her; she is a dear, kind creature, and will be
delighted to hear it; so I'll save it for her."</p>

<p>Madame de Fonbonne was a fat little woman, of about
fifty years of age, very pretending, and very ridiculous.
Her fat double chin rested on her equally fat throat;
and she was continually talking, with upturned eyes, of
her tender, her sensitive soul; the languor of her soul;
the craving of her soul; the aspirations of her soul. To
these disadvantages, she added the additional one of
being particularly ill-dressed, upon the present occasion,
in a horrible-looking copper-coloured turban, with a
sprinkling of green flowers over it.</p>

<p>"Yes," again asserted De Lucenay, in his loudest
voice, "that charming anecdote shall be told to Madame
de Fonbonne."</p>

<p>"May I be permitted, my lord duke, to inquire the
subject of your conversation?" said the lady thus apostrophised,
who, hearing her name mentioned, immediately
commenced her usual mincing, bridling attempts to draw
up her chubby self, but, failing in the effort, fell back
upon the easier man&oelig;uvre of "rolling up the whites of
her eyes," as it is commonly called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"It refers, madame, to a most horribly indecent, revolting,
and strange story."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless me! and who dares&mdash;oh, dear me,
who would venture&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would, madame. I can answer for the truth of the
anecdote, and that it would make a stick or a stone
blush to hear it; but, as I am aware how dearly you
love such stories, I will relate it to you. You must
know, then, that in Otaheite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lord," exclaimed the indignant lady, turning up
her eyes with indignant horror, "it really is surprising
you can allow yourself to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now for those unkind looks you shall not hear my
pretty story either, though I had been reserving it for
you. And, now I look at you, I can but wonder that
you, so celebrated for the taste and good style of your
dress, should have put that wretched thing on your head
for a turban, but which looks more like an old copper
baking-dish spotted all over with verdigris." So saying,
the duke, as if charmed with his own wit, burst into a
loud and long peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"If, my lord," exclaimed the enraged lady, "you
merely returned from the East to resume your offensive
jokes, which are tolerated because you are supposed to
be only half in your senses, all who know you are bound
to hope you intend to return as quickly as you came;"
saying which she arose, and majestically waddled away.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Lady Macgregor, if I don't take
devilish good care, I shall let fly at that stupid old prude
and pull her old stew-pan off her head," said M. de
Lucenay, thrusting his hands deep down into his pockets
as if to prevent their committing the retaliating mischief
he contemplated. "But no," said he, after a pause, "I
won't hurt the 'sensitive soul,' poor innocent thing!
Ha! ha! ha! Besides, think of her being an orphan
at her tender age!" And renewed peals of laughter
announced that the imagination of the duke had again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
found a fresh fund of amusement in some reminiscence
of Madame de Fonbonne; which, however, soon gave
place to an expression of surprise, as the figure of the
commandant, sauntering towards them, caught his eye.</p>

<p>"Holla!" cried he, "there's M. Charles Robert.
I met him last summer at the German baths; he is
a deuced fine fellow,&mdash;sings like a swan. Now, marquise,
I'll show you some fun,&mdash;just see how I'll bother
him. Would you like me to introduce him to you?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, if you can," said Sarah, turning her back
most unceremoniously upon M. de Lucenay, "and let us
alone, I beg."</p>

<p>As M. Charles Robert, while affecting to be solely
occupied in admiring the rare plants on either side of
him, continued to advance, M. de Lucenay had cleverly
contrived to get possession of Sarah's <i>flacon d'esprit</i>, and
was deeply and silently engaged in the interesting
employment of demolishing the stopper of the trinket.</p>

<p>Still M. Charles Robert kept on his gradual approach
to the party he was, in reality, making the object of his
visit. His figure was tall and finely proportioned; his
features boasted the most faultless regularity; his dress
was in the first style of modern elegance; yet his
countenance, his whole person, were destitute of grace,
or that <i>distingué</i> air which is more to be coveted than
mere beauty, whether of face or figure; his movements
were stiff and constrained, and his hands and feet large
and coarse. As he approached Madame d'Harville his
insipid and insignificant countenance assumed, all at
once, an expression of the deepest melancholy, too
sudden to be genuine; nevertheless he acted the part as
closely to nature as might be. M. Robert had the air
of a man so thoroughly wretched, so oppressed by a
multitude of sorrows, that as he came up to Madame
d'Harville she could not help recalling to mind the
fearful mention made by Sarah touching the violence
to which grief such as his might drive him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you? How are you, my dear sir?"
exclaimed the Duke de Lucenay, interrupting the
further approach of the commandant. "I have not
had the pleasure of seeing you since we met at the
spas of &mdash;&mdash;. But what the devil ails you,&mdash;are you
ill?"</p>

<p>Hereupon M. Charles Robert assumed a languid and
sentimental air, and, casting a melancholy look towards
Madame d'Harville, replied, in a tone of deep depression:</p>

<p>"Indeed, my lord, I am very far from being well."</p>

<p>"God bless me! Why, what is the matter with you?
Ah! I suppose that confounded plaguy cough still sticks
to you," said M. de Lucenay, with an appearance of the
most serious interest in the inquiry.</p>

<p>At this ridiculous question, M. Charles Robert stood
for a moment as though struck dumb with astonishment,
but, quickly recovering himself, said, while his face
crimsoned, and his voice trembled with rage, in a short,
firm voice, to M. de Lucenay:</p>

<p>"Since you express so much uneasiness respecting my
health, my lord, I trust you will not fail calling to-morrow
to know how I am."</p>

<p>"Upon my life and soul, my dear sir, I&mdash;but most
certainly I will send," said the duke, with a haughty
bow to M. Charles Robert, who, coolly returning it,
walked away.</p>

<p>"The best of the joke is," said M. de Lucenay,
throwing himself again by the side of Sarah, "that
our tall friend there had no more of a spitting complaint
than the great Turk himself,&mdash;unless, indeed, I stumbled
upon the truth without knowing it. Well, he might
have that complaint for anything I know or care.
What do you think, Lady Macgregor,&mdash;did that great,
tall fellow look, to you, as though he were suffering
from <i>la pituite?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A sort of viscous, phlegmy complaint.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sarah's only reply was an indignant rising from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
seat, and hasty removal from the vicinage of the annoying
Duke de Lucenay.</p>

<p>All this had passed with the rapidity of thought.
Sarah had experienced considerable difficulty in restraining
her inclination to indulge in a hearty fit of laughter
at the absurd question put by the Duke de Lucenay to
the commandant; but Madame d'Harville had painfully
sympathised with the feelings of a man so ridiculously
interrogated in the presence of the woman he loved.
Then, horror-struck as the probable consequences of
the duke's jest rose to her mind, led away by her dread
of the duel which might arise out of it, and still further
instigated by a feeling of deep pity for one who seemed
to her misled imagination as marked out for every
venomed shaft of envy, malice, and revenge, Clémence
rose abruptly from her seat, took the arm of Sarah,
overtook M. Charles Robert, who was boiling over with
rage, and whispered to him, as she passed:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at one o'clock, I will be there."</p>

<p>Then, regaining the gallery with the countess, she
immediately quitted the ball.</p>

<p>Rodolph, in appearing at this fête, besides fulfilling
a duty imposed on him by his exalted rank and place
in society, was further influenced by the earnest desire
to ascertain how far his suspicions, as regarded Madame
d'Harville, were well founded, and if she were, indeed,
the heroine of Madame Pipelet's account. After quitting
the winter garden with the Countess de &mdash;&mdash;, he had,
in vain, traversed the various salons in the hopes of
meeting Madame d'Harville alone. He was returning
to the hothouse when, being momentarily delayed at
the top of the stairs, he was witness to the rapid scene
between Madame d'Harville and M. Charles Robert after
the joke played off by the Duke de Lucenay. The
significant glances exchanged between Clémence and
the commandant struck Rodolph powerfully, and impressed
him with the firm conviction that this tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and prepossessing individual was the mysterious lodger
of the Rue du Temple. Wishing for still further confirmation
of the idea, he returned to the gallery.
A waltz was about to commence, and in the course
of a few minutes he saw M. Charles Robert standing
in the doorway, evidently revelling in the satisfaction
of his own ideas; enjoying, in the first place, the
recollection of his own retort to M. de Lucenay (for
M. Charles Robert, spite of his egregious folly and
vanity, was by no means destitute of bravery), and,
secondly, revelling in the triumph of thus obtaining
a voluntary assignation with Madame d'Harville for
the morrow; and something assured him that this time
she would be punctual. Rodolph sought for Murphy.</p>

<p>"Do you see that fair young man," said he, "standing
in the midst of that group out there?"</p>

<p>"You mean the tall individual who seems so much
amused with his own thoughts, do you not? Yes, yes,
I see him."</p>

<p>"Endeavour to get sufficiently near to him to be
enabled to whisper, so that he alone can catch the
words, while you carefully avoid allowing him to see
the person who utters them, this sentence, 'You are
late, my angel!'"</p>

<p>The squire gazed at Rodolph with a perplexed air.</p>

<p>"My lord, do you seriously wish me to do this?"</p>

<p>"Seriously, my dear Murphy, I do; and should he
hastily turn around when you have spoken, assume that
incomparable air of perfect nonchalance for which you
are so justly celebrated, so as to prevent his being able
to fix upon you as the person who has spoken."</p>

<p>"Depend upon my perfect obedience, my lord, although
I am far from having the slightest idea of your intention
in assigning to me such a task."</p>

<p>Before the conclusion of the waltz, the worthy
Murphy had contrived to place himself immediately
behind M. Charles Robert, while Rodolph, posted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
situation most advantageous for watching the effect of
this experiment, carefully observed Murphy's movements.
In a minute, M. Charles Robert turned suddenly
around, as though struck with astonishment and
wonder. The immovable squire stirred not a feature;
and certainly Murphy's tall, portly figure, bald head,
and grave, composed countenance, appeared the least
likely of any in the room to be those of a man taking
part in such a trick; and, indeed, it was evident, from
the continued gaze of the commandant in every other
part of the space they stood in, that M. Charles Robert
was far from suspecting his respectable, middle-aged
neighbour of giving utterance to a phrase so disagreeably
recalling the <i>quid pro quo</i> of which Madame Pipelet
had been alike the cause and the heroine. The waltz
concluded, Murphy rejoined Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Well, my lord," said he, "that smart young gentleman
jumped as though he had trodden on a hornet's
nest. The words I uttered appeared to have the effect of
magic on him."</p>

<p>"They were so far magical, my dear Murphy, as they
assisted me to discover a circumstance I was most
anxious to find out."</p>

<p>Conviction thus painfully obtained, Rodolph could
only deplore the dangerous position in which Madame
d'Harville had placed herself, and which seemed to him
fraught with fresh evils, from a vague presentiment of
Sarah's being either a sharer or a confidant in the
transaction, and with this discovery came the fresh
pain of believing that he had now found out the source
of M. d'Harville's secret sorrow; the man he so highly
esteemed, and for whom he felt a brother's regard, was
pining in silence over the misconduct of a wife he so
tenderly loved, yet who, in spite of her many charming
qualities, could sacrifice her own and her husband's
happiness for the sake of an object so every way
unworthy. Master of so important a secret, yet incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of betraying it, unable to devise any plan to
open the eyes of Madame d'Harville, who seemed rather
to yield to than resist her unlicensed passion for her
lover, Rodolph found himself obliged to remain a passive
witness to the utter ruin of a woman he had so
passionately adored with as much silence as devotion;
nay, whom, spite of his best efforts, he still loved. He
was roused from these reflections by M. de Graün.</p>

<p>"If your royal highness," said the baron, bowing,
"will deign to grant me a brief interview in one of
the lower rooms, which is now quite devoid of company,
I shall have the honour to lay before you the particulars
you desired me to collect."</p>

<p>Rodolph signed to M. de Graün to conduct him to the
place named, when the baron proceeded with his recital,
as follows:</p>

<p>"The only duchess to whose name the initials 'N.'
and 'L.' can possibly belong is Madame de Lucenay,
whose maiden name was Normant. Her grace is not
here this evening. I have just seen M. de Lucenay, her
husband, who, it seems, left Paris five months ago, with
the expressed intention of travelling in the East during
the next year or two, but has unexpectedly returned
within the last day or two."</p>

<p>It may be recollected that, during Rodolph's visit to
the Rue du Temple, he picked up, on the landing-place
adjoining the door of the charlatan dentist's apartments,
a cambric handkerchief, richly embroidered and trimmed
with costly lace, and bearing in the corner a ducal coronet
with the initials "N. L." It will also be borne in
mind that this elegant indication of high rank was wetted
with the bitter tears of its noble owner. In pursuance of
his instructions, but in total ignorance of the circumstances
suggesting them, M. de Graün had inquired the
name of every duchess then in Paris, and gleaned the information
now repeated to Rodolph, and which the latter
perfectly comprehended. He had no reason for interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
himself in the fate of Madame de Lucenay; but he
could not reflect without a shudder that, if it were really
she who visited the pretended doctor (but who, he felt
assured, was no other than the infamous Polidori), this
wretch, having possessed himself of her real name and
address through the agency of Tortillard, might make
a fearful use of a secret which placed the duchess so
completely in his power.</p>

<p>"Chance is a strange thing, my lord, is it not?"
resumed M. de Graün.</p>

<p>"It is; but how does it apply to the present case?"</p>

<p>"Why, at the very instant that M. de Grangeneuve
was giving me these facts concerning M. and Madame de
Lucenay, and was adding, rather ill-naturedly, that the
unlooked-for return of the duke must have proved particularly
disagreeable, not only to the duchess but to the
Viscount de Saint-Remy, one of the most elegant and
fashionable men in Paris, his excellency the ambassador
came up and inquired whether your royal highness would
permit him to present the viscount to you, as, having just
been appointed on the legation to Gerolstein, he would
be happy to avail himself of the present opportunity of
paying his court to your highness."</p>

<p>An expression of impatience escaped Rodolph, who
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Nothing could have been less agreeable to me. However,
it is impossible to refuse. Let the count know,
therefore, that I am ready to receive M. de Saint-Remy."</p>

<p>Rodolph knew too well how to support his princely
dignity to allow his feelings to interfere with the courtesy
and affability required on the present occasion;
added to which, the world gave M. de Saint-Remy as
a favoured lover to the Duchess de Lucenay, and this
circumstance greatly excited the curiosity of Rodolph.</p>

<p>The Viscount de Saint-Remy, conducted by the Count
de &mdash;&mdash;, now approached. He was an exceedingly handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
young man, of about twenty-five years of age,
tall and slender, with the most <i>distingué</i> air and prepossessing
physiognomy; his olive complexion had that rich,
soft glow of amber cast over its transparent surface, so
remarkable in the paintings of Murillo; his glossy black
hair, parted over his left temple, was worn smooth over
his forehead, and fell in light and easy curls down the
sides of his face, almost concealing the pale, well-shaped
ear. The deep, dark eyelash contrasted well with the
clear eye it shaded, the crystal of which was tinged with
that blue cast which bestows so much and such charming
expression to the Indian eye. By a singular caprice of
nature, the thick, silky moustache which graced his lip
was the only ornament of a similar description visible
on his countenance, the chin and cheeks being smooth
as those of a young maiden. Perhaps it might be
vanity which dictated the narrow black satin cravat
placed so low as to reveal the perfect contour of a
throat which, for whiteness and symmetrical roundness,
might have furnished a model for the artist's
studio. The long ends of his cravat were confined by
a single pearl, inestimable for its size, the beauty of its
shape, and the splendour of its colour,&mdash;so vivid, that an
opal could scarcely have rivalled its continued prismatic
changes. The perfect taste, and exquisite style of M.
de Saint-Remy harmonised well with the magnificent
simplicity of this jewel.</p>

<p>Once seen, the face and figure of M. de Saint-Remy was
never forgotten, so entirely did it differ from the usual
style of <i>élégants</i>. He spared no expense in procuring the
most faultless turnout, and his carriages and horses were
everywhere cited as models of taste and correct judgment.
He played high, but skilfully; while the annual
amount of his betting-book was never less than from two
to three thousand louis. The costly elegance of his
mansion, in the Rue de Chaillot, was everywhere spoken
of and admired. There he gave the most exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dinner-parties. The highest play followed, and the
hospitable host would lose large and heavy sums
with the most perfect indifference, though it was known
that his fortune had been dissipated long ago. All
the viscount's property had been derived from his
mother; while his father lived in utter seclusion in the
wilds of Anjou, upon an income of the most slender
description.</p>

<p>By way of accounting for the unbounded expenditure
of M. de Saint-Remy, many among the envious or ill-natured
referred, as Sarah had done, to the large fortune
of the Duchess de Lucenay; but they forgot that, setting
aside the infamy of the idea, M. de Lucenay would naturally
direct the disposal of his wife's property, and that
M. de Saint-Remy's annual expenses were at least two
hundred thousand francs. Suspicions were entertained
of his being deeply indebted to imprudent money-lenders;
for Saint-Remy had no further inheritance to look forward
to. Others, again, spoke of his great successes on
the turf, and hinted, in an undertone, dark stories of
training-grounds, and jockeys bribed by him to make
the horses against which he had betted largely lose;
but by far the greater number of the crowd by which
Saint-Remy was surrounded was content to eat his
dinners, and occasionally to win his rouleaux, without
troubling themselves with conjectures as to how the one
was provided, and where the other came from.</p>

<p>By birth and education he was fully entitled to the
rank he occupied in the fashionable world; he was lively,
witty, brave, a most amusing companion, obliging and
complaisant to the wishes of others; he gave first-rate
bachelor dinners, and afterwards took every bet that was
offered him. What more was required to secure his
popularity? He was an universal favourite with the
fair sex, and could boast the most unvaried success
in all his love affairs; he was young, handsome,
gallant, and unsparingly munificent upon all occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
where opportunities occurred of marking his
devotion towards the high-bred females with whom
he associated in the <i>grande monde</i>; in a word, thanks
to the general infatuation he excited, the air of mystery
thrown over the source of the Pactolus from which he
derived his golden supplies rather embellished him with
a certain mysterious charm, which seemed but to add to
his attractions. Sometimes it would be said, with a
careless smile, "What a fellow that Saint-Remy is: he
must have discovered the philosopher's stone to be able
to go the pace he does." And when it was known that
he had caused himself to be attached to the legation of
France to the court of Gerolstein, there were not wanting
voices to assert that it was a "devilish good way of
making an honourable retreat." Such was M. de Saint-Remy.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said the Count de &mdash;&mdash;, presenting M.
de Saint-Remy, "to introduce to your royal highness
the Viscount de Saint-Remy, attached to the embassy
of Gerolstein."</p>

<p>The viscount bowed profoundly, saying:</p>

<p>"May I trust your royal highness will deign to pardon
my impatience in requesting the honour of this introduction
during the present evening? I am, perhaps, unduly
hasty in my wishes to secure a gratification I have so
long aspired to."</p>

<p>"It will give me much pleasure, my lord, to welcome
you to Gerolstein. Do you propose going thither
immediately?"</p>

<p>"Your royal highness being in Paris diminishes very
materially my desire to do so."</p>

<p>"I fear the peaceful contrast of our German courts
will scarcely assort with a life of Parisian fashion, such
as you have always been accustomed to."</p>

<p>"Permit me to assure your royal highness that the
gracious kindness you have now shown me, and which it
shall be my study to merit a continuance of in Gerolstein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
would of itself far outweigh any attractions Paris may
have had for me."</p>

<p>"It will not be my fault, my lord, should you see
cause to alter your sentiments when at Gerolstein."</p>

<p>A slight inclination of Rodolph's head announced that
the presentation was concluded, upon which the viscount
bowed and retired. The prince, a practised physiognomist,
was subject to involuntary likes and dislikes upon
the first interview with an individual, and these impulses
were in his case almost invariably borne out by after-circumstances.
His first sensation after the exchange of
the very few words we have related between himself and
Saint-Remy was an unaccountable feeling of repugnance
and aversion for the gay and fascinating young man; to
his eye, the handsome features wore a sinister look, and
danger seemed to lurk even in his honeyed words and
smooth, polished manner.</p>

<p>We shall hereafter meet M. de Saint-Remy under circumstances
differing widely and fearfully from the splendour
of the position he occupied at his first interview
with Rodolph. It will then be seen how far these
presentiments were ill or well founded.</p>

<p>The presentation over, Rodolph, in deep meditation
upon the singular rencontres effected by the hand of
chance, bent his steps towards the winter garden. It
was now the hour of supper, and the rooms were nearly
deserted. The most retired spot in the hothouse was at
the end of a clump of trees placed against the corner of
a wall, and an enormous banana, covered with climbing
plants, effectually concealed a small side door, masked
by the trellis, and conducting to the banquetting-hall
by a long corridor. This door, which was scarcely a
yard distant from the tree above mentioned, had been
left temporarily ajar. Sheltered by this verdant screen,
Rodolph seated himself, and was soon lost in a profound
reverie, when the sound of a well-known voice, pronouncing
his name, made Rodolph start. It was Sarah, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
seated with her brother Tom on the other side of the
clump of trees which effectually hid Rodolph from their
view, was conversing with him in the English language.
The prince listened attentively, and the following dialogue
ensued:</p>

<p>"The marquise has just gone to show herself for a
few minutes at Baron de Nerval's ball," said Sarah;
"she has luckily quitted this place without once having
an opportunity of exchanging a word with Rodolph, who
has been looking everywhere for her. I still dread the
influence he possesses over her, even unknown to herself,&mdash;an
influence it has cost me so much labour and difficulty
to combat, and partly to destroy. However, to-morrow
will rid me of any further fears of a rival who, if not
effectually destroyed, might so powerfully derange and
overthrow my plans. Listen to me, brother, for it is of
serious matters I would speak to you. To-morrow
witnesses the eternal ruin of my hated rival."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Sarah," answered Tom's well-remembered
voice; "Rodolph never loved the marquise;
of that I am certain; your jealous fears mislead you."</p>

<p>"It is time," returned Sarah, "that I enlightened you
on this subject. Many things occurred during your last
journey, and as it is necessary to take decisive steps even
earlier than I had expected,&mdash;nay, this very night,&mdash;so
soon as we quit this place, it becomes indispensably
necessary we should take serious counsel together.
Happily we are now quite alone, for the gay butterflies
of the night have found fresh attraction around the
supper-tables. Now, then, brother, give your close and
undivided attention to what I am about to say."</p>

<p>"Proceed, I am all impatience."</p>

<p>"Well, before Clémence d'Harville met Rodolph, I
feel assured the passion of love was wholly unknown to
her, for what reason I have never been able to discover.
She entertains the most invincible repugnance and aversion
towards her husband, who perfectly adores her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
There is some deep mystery in this part of the business
I have never succeeded in fathoming. A thousand new
and delightful emotions sprang up in the breast of Clémence
after she became acquainted with Rodolph; but I
stifled her growing love by the most frightful disclosures,
or rather ingeniously invented calumnies, concerning the
prince. Still, the void in her heart required an object
to fill it, and chance having thrown M. Charles Robert
in her way during a morning call she was making at my
house, she appeared struck with his appearance, much
after the manner in which we are attracted by a fine
picture. Unfortunately, however, this man is as silly
as he is handsome, though he certainly has a very prepossessing
<i>tout ensemble</i>. I praised him enthusiastically
to Madame d'Harville, exalted the nobleness of his sentiments,
the elevation of his mind, and, as I knew her
weak side, I worked upon her sympathy and pity, by
representing him as loaded with every trouble and
affliction unrelenting fate could heap upon a devoted
but most innocent head. I directed M. Robert to assume
a melancholy and sentimental air; to utter only deep
sighs, and to preserve a gloomy and unbroken silence
in the presence of Madame d'Harville. He carefully
pursued the path marked out by me, and, thanks to his
vocal skill, his fine person and the constant expression
of silent suffering, so far engaged the interest of Madame
d'Harville, that, ere long, she transferred to my handsome
friend the warm and sympathising regard Rodolph
had first awakened. Do you comprehend me thus far?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; proceed."</p>

<p>"Madame d'Harville and Robert met only upon terms
of intimacy at my house; to draw them more effectually
together I projected devoting three mornings in the
week to music, and my mournful ally sighed softly as
the breath of evening while turning over the leaves of the
music, ventured to utter a few impassioned words, and
even to slip two or three billets among the pieces he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
copied out for the marquise to practise at home. I own
I was more fearful of his epistolary efforts than even his
powers of speech; but a woman always looks indulgently
upon the first declaration of love she receives; so far,
therefore, the written nonsense of my silly pupil did no
harm, for, in obedience to my advice, his <i>billets doux</i>
were very laconic. The great point was to obtain a
rendezvous, and this was no easy matter, for Clémence's
principles were stronger than her love; or, rather, her
passion was not sufficiently deep to induce her to sacrifice
those principles. Unknown, even to herself, the
image of Rodolph still filled her heart, and seemed in
a manner to preserve her from yielding to her weak fancy
for M. Charles Robert,&mdash;a fancy, as I well knew, far
more imaginary than real; but, led on by my continual
and exaggerated praises of this brainless Apollo, whom
I persisted in describing as suffering under the daily
increase of every imaginary evil I could invent, Clémence,
vanquished by the deep despair of her dejected
adorer, consented one day, more from pity than love,
to grant him the rendezvous so long desired."</p>

<p>"Did she, then, make you her confidant?"</p>

<p>"She confessed to me her regard for M. Charles
Robert,&mdash;nothing more; neither did I seek to learn
more; it would have annoyed and vexed her. But, as
for him, boiling over with love, or, rather, intoxicated
with pride, he came voluntarily to impart his good fortune,
without, however, entrusting me either with the
time or place of the intended meeting."</p>

<p>"How, then, did you know it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Karl, by my order, hovered about the door of
M. Robert during the following day from an early hour;
nothing, however, transpired till the next day, when our
love-stricken youth proceeded in a <i>fiacre</i> to an obscure
part of the town, and finally alighted before a mean-looking
house in the Rue du Temple; there he remained
for an hour and a half, when he came out and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
away. Karl waited a long while to see whether any person
followed M. Charles Robert out of the house; but
no one came. The marquise had evidently failed in her
appointment. This was confirmed to me on the morrow,
when the lover came to pour out all his rage and disappointment.
I advised him to assume even an increase
of wretchedness and despair. The plan succeeded; the
pity of Clémence was again excited; a fresh assignation
was wrung from her, but which she failed to keep equally
with the former; the third and last rendezvous, however,
produced more decided effects, Madame d'Harville positively
going as far as the door of the house I have
specified as the appointed place; then, repenting so
rash a step, returned home without having even quitted
the humble <i>fiacre</i> in which she rode. You may judge
by all these capricious changes of purpose how this
woman struggles to be free. And wherefore? Why,
because (and hence arises my bitter, deadly hatred
to Clémence d'Harville) because the recollection of
Rodolph still lingers in her heart, and, with pertinacious
love she shrinks from aught that she fancies
breathes of preference for another; thus shielding herself
from harm or danger beneath his worshipped image.
Now this very night the marquise has made a fresh
assignation with M. Charles Robert for to-morrow, and
this time I doubt not her punctuality; the Duke de Lucenay
has so grossly ridiculed this young man that, carried
away by pity for the humiliation of her admirer, the
marquise has granted that to compassion he would not
else have obtained. But this time, I feel persuaded she
will keep her word, and be punctual to the appointed
time and hour."</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to act?"</p>

<p>"M. Charles Robert is so perfectly unable to comprehend
the delicacy of feeling which this evening dictated
the marquise's resolution of meeting him, that he is safe
to rush with vulgar eagerness to the rendezvous, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
will effectually ruin his plans, for pity alone has instigated
Clémence to take this compromising step.
No love,&mdash;no infatuation has hurried her into a
measure so fatal to her future resolution. I know
every turn of her mind; and I am confident she will
keep her appointment solely from a courageous idea of
generous devotion, but with a firm resolve not for one
instant to forget her duties as a wife and mother. Now
the coarse, vulgar mind of M. Charles Robert is sure to
take the fullest advantage of the marquise's concession in
his favour. Clémence will detest him from that instant;
and the illusion once destroyed which has bound herself
and Charles Robert in bonds of imaginary sympathy,
she will fall again beneath the influence of her love
for Rodolph, which I am certain still nestles in her
heart."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well! I would have her for ever lost to Rodolph,
whose high sense of honour and deep friendship for
M. d'Harville I feel perfectly sure would not have
proved equal to preventing his returning the love of
Clémence; but I will so manage things that he shall
henceforward look upon her with loathing and disgust,
as the guilty partner in a crime committed without his
participation. No, no! I know my man. He might
pardon the offence, but never the being excluded from
his share in it."</p>

<p>"Then do you propose apprising the husband of all
that is going on, so that the prince should learn the disgraceful
circumstances from the publicity the affair would
obtain?"</p>

<p>"I do. And the thing is so much the easier to accomplish
as, from what fell from Clémence to-night, I can
learn that the marquis has vague and undefined suspicions,
without knowing on whom to fix them. It is
now midnight; we shall almost directly leave the ball, I
will set you down at the first café we meet with, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
you shall write M. d'Harville a minute account of his
wife's love affair, with the projected assignation of to-morrow,
with the time and place where it is arranged
to take place. Oh! but I forgot, I didn't state that the
place of meeting is No. 17 Rue du Temple. And the
time, to-morrow at one o'clock. The marquis is already
jealous of Clémence; well, he will by this information
surprise her under most suspicious circumstances; the
rest follows as a matter of course."</p>

<p>"But this is a most abominable mode of action," said
Seyton, coldly.</p>

<p>"What! my trusty and well-behaved brother and
colleague growing scrupulous?" said Sarah, sarcastically.
"This will never do; suppose my modes of
action are odious,&mdash;so be it. I trample on all and
every thing that interferes with my designs,&mdash;agreed.
I do&mdash;I shall, till I have secured my purpose. But let
me ask you, Who thought of scruples when my destruction
was aimed at? Who thought of me or my feelings,
let me ask you? How have I been treated?"</p>

<p>"Say no more, sister,&mdash;say no more,&mdash;here is my
hand, and you may safely reckon upon my firm participation
in all that concerns you, even to writing the letter
to M. d'Harville. But still I say, and repeat, such conduct
is horrible!"</p>

<p>"Never mind sermonising, but say, do you consent
fully and entirely to what I wish you, or do you not?
Ay, or nay?"</p>

<p>"Since it must be so, M. d'Harville shall this night
be fully instructed as to all his wife's proceedings,&mdash;but&mdash;what
is that? I fancied I heard some one on the other
side of this thicket,&mdash;there was a rustling of leaves and
branches," said Seyton, interrupting himself, and speaking
to Sarah in a low and suppressed voice.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," cried Sarah, uneasily, "don't
stop to talk about it, but quick! and examine the other
side of this place!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Seyton rose,&mdash;made the tour of the clump of trees,&mdash;but
saw no one.</p>

<p>Rodolph had just disappeared by the side door, of
which we have before spoken.</p>

<p>"I must have made a mistake," said Seyton, returning;
"there is no appearance of any persons but ourselves
being in this place."</p>

<p>"I thought there could not possibly be."</p>

<p>"Now, then, Sarah, hear what I have got to say on
the subject of Madame d'Harville, who, I feel quite
satisfied, you make an object of unnecessary apprehension,
as far as it would be possible for her to
interfere with your schemes. The prince, moreover,
has certain principles nothing would induce him to
infringe. I am infinitely more alarmed, and with
greater justice, too, as to what can have been his intentions
in conducting that young girl to his farm at
Bouqueval, five or six weeks ago. He is constant in his
superintendence of her health and comfort; is having
her well educated, and, moreover, has been several times
to see her. Now we are altogether ignorant who she is
or where she came from; she seems, however, to belong
only to the humbler ranks of society; still, the exquisite
style of her beauty, the fact of the prince having worn
the disguise he did when escorting her to the farm, the
increasing interest he seems to take in her welfare, all
go to prove that his regard for her is of no common
description. I have, therefore, in this affair anticipated
your wishes; but to remove this greater, and, as I believe,
more serious obstacle to our plans, the utmost
circumspection was requisite to obtain information
respecting the lives and habits of these mysterious
occupants of the farm, and particularly concerning
the girl herself. I have been fortunate enough to
learn nearly sufficient to point out what is to be
done the moment for action has arrived. A most
singular chance threw that horrid old woman in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
way, to whom, as you remember, I once gave my address,
which she it seems has carefully preserved. Her
connection with such persons as the robber who attacked
us during our late visit to the Cité will powerfully assist
us. All is provided for and preconsidered,&mdash;there can
be no proof against us,&mdash;and, besides, if, as seems evident,
this young creature belongs to the humblest class of
society it is not very probable she will hesitate between
our offers and the splendid prospect she may, perchance,
picture to herself, for the prince, I have ascertained, has
preserved a strict incognito towards her. But to-morrow
shall decide the question otherwise,&mdash;we shall see,&mdash;we
shall see."</p>

<p>"And these two obstacles overcome, then, Tom, for
our grand project."</p>

<p>"There are many, and serious obstacles in the way;
still, they may be overcome."</p>

<p>"And would it not be a lucky chance if we should
bring it to pass at the very moment when Rodolph
would be writhing under the double misery occasioned
by the disclosure of Madame d'Harville's conduct, and
the disappearance of the creature for whom he chooses
to evince so deep an interest? Would not that be an
auspicious moment to persuade him that the daughter,
whose loss he daily more and more deplores, still lives?
And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sister," interrupted Seyton, "I hear the
steps of the guests from the supper-table, returning to
resume the ball. Since you deem it expedient to apprise
the Marquis d'Harville of the morrow's rendezvous, let
us depart; it is past midnight."</p>

<p>"The lateness of the hour in which the anonymous
information will reach M. d'Harville, will but tend still
more to impress him with an idea of its importance."</p>

<p>And with these words Tom and Sarah quitted the
splendid ball of the ambassadress of the court of &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h5>THE RENDEZVOUS.</h5>


<p>Determined at all risks to warn Madame d'Harville of
the danger she was incurring, Rodolph had quitted the
winter garden without waiting to hear the remainder of
the conversation between Sarah and her brother, thus
remaining ignorant of their designs against Fleur-de-Marie,
and of the extreme peril which threatened the
poor girl. But, spite of his earnest desire to apprise
the marquise of the plot laid against her peace and
honour, he was unable to carry his design into execution,
for Madame d'Harville, unable to bear up longer after
the trying events of the evening, had abandoned her
original intention of visiting the entertainment given by
Madame de Nerval and gone direct home.</p>

<p>This contretemps ruined his hopes. Nearly the whole
of the company present at the ambassadress's ball had
been invited to that of Madame de Nerval's, and Rodolph
drove rapidly thither, taking with him M. de Graün, to
whom he gave instructions to look for Madame d'Harville
among the guests, and to acquaint her that the
prince, having something of the utmost consequence to
communicate to her without the least delay, would walk
onwards to the Hôtel d'Harville, and await her return
home, when he would say a few words at the carriage-door
while her servants were attending to the opening of
the entrance-gates.</p>

<p>After much time spent in fruitless endeavours to find
Madame d'Harville, De Graün was compelled to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
with the account of his ill success. This failure made
Rodolph despair of being able, now, to save the marquise
from impending ruin; his first thought had been to
warn her of the treachery intended, and so prevent the
statement of Sarah, which he had no means of keeping
from the hands of M. d'Harville, from obtaining the
slightest credence. Alas! it was now too late. The
infamous epistle dictated by the Countess Macgregor had
reached the Marquis d'Harville shortly after midnight
on the night in question.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>It was morning; and M. d'Harville continued slowly
to pace his sleeping-apartment, the bed of which gave no
indication of having been used during the night, though
the silken counterpane hung in fragments, evidently
proving that some powerful and devastating storm had
possessed the mind of its owner.</p>

<p>The chamber in question was furnished with elegant
simplicity, its only ornaments consisting of a stand of
modern arms and a range of shelves furnished with a
well-chosen collection of books. Yet a sudden frenzy,
or the hand of ungovernable rage, had reduced the quiet
elegance which ordinarily reigned to a scene of frantic
disorder. Chairs, tables, broken and overset; the carpet
strewed with fragments of the crystal lamp kept burning
through the night; the wax-lights and gilded chandelier
which had contained them, lying around, gave manifest
evidence of a fearful scene.</p>

<p>M. d'Harville was about thirty years of age, with
a fine, manly countenance, whose usual expression was
mild and prepossessing, but now contracted, haggard,
and livid. He had not changed his dress since the preceding
evening; his throat was bare, his waistcoat thrown
open, and on the torn and rumpled cambric of his shirt-front
were drops of blood. His rich, dark hair, which
generally fell in curls around his face, now hung in tangled
wildness over his pale countenance. Wholly buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in the misery of his own thoughts, with folded arms,
drooping head, and fixed, bloodshot eyes, M. d'Harville
continued to pace his chamber; then, stopping opposite
his fireplace, in which, spite of the almost unendurable
severity of the frost of the past night, the fire had been
allowed to expire, he took from the marble mantelpiece
the following brief note, which he continued to read over
and over with the most eager attention by the wan, pale
light of the cold glimmer of an early winter morning:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"To-morrow, at one o'clock, your wife has appointed to meet
her favoured lover. Go to the Rue du Temple, No. 17, and you
will obtain every requisite confirmation of this intelligence.</p>

<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">From one who pities you</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Whilst reading these words, perused, with such deep
anguish and sickness of heart, so many times through
the long midnight hours, the blue, cold lips of M. d'Harville
appeared convulsively to spell each syllable of this
fatal <i>billet</i>.</p>

<p>At this moment the chamber door opened and a servant
entered; the man who now made his appearance
was old, even gray-headed, but the expression of his
countenance was frank and honest. The noise of the
man entering disturbed not the marquis from his bitter
contemplations; he merely turned his head without altering
his position, but still grasped the letter in his
clenched hands.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" inquired he, sternly, of the
servant.</p>

<p>The man, instead of answering, continued to gaze with
an air of painful surprise at the disordered state of the
room; then, regarding his master more attentively,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Blood on your clothes! My lord, my lord! How
is this? You have hurt yourself,&mdash;and all alone, too;
why, my lord, did you not summon me, as of old,
when these attacks came on?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Begone!"</p>

<p>"I entreat your lordship's pardon, but your fire is out,&mdash;the
cold is intense,&mdash;indeed, I must remind your lordship
that after your late&mdash;your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you be silent? Leave me I say!"</p>

<p>"Pray do not be angry, my lord," replied the trembling
valet; "but, if your lordship pleases to recollect,
you appointed M. Doublet to be here to-day at half past
ten, and he is now waiting with the notary."</p>

<p>"Quite proper," said the marquis, with a bitter smile;
"when a man is rich he ought, he should look carefully
to his affairs. Fortune is a fine thing,&mdash;a very fine
thing; or would be if it could but purchase happiness."
Then, resuming a cold and collected manner, he added:</p>

<p>"Show M. Doublet into my study."</p>

<p>"I have done so, my lord marquis."</p>

<p>"Then give me my clothes,&mdash;quick, I am in haste;
I shall be going out shortly. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if your lordship would only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do as I desire you, Joseph," said M. d'Harville, in a
more gentle tone; then added, "Is your lady stirring
yet?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet heard her ladyship's bell, my lord
marquis."</p>

<p>"Let me know when she rings."</p>

<p>"I will, my lord."</p>

<p>"Heaven and earth, man, how slow you are!" exclaimed
M. d'Harville, whose raging thoughts almost
chafed him into madness; "summon Philip to assist
you; you will keep me all day."</p>

<p>"My lord, please to allow me to set matters a little
straight first," replied Joseph, sorrowfully; "I would
much rather no one but myself witnessed the state of
your chamber, or they would wonder, and talk about it,
because they could not understand what had taken place
during the night, my lord."</p>

<p>"And if they were to find out, it would be a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
shocking affair,&mdash;would it not?" asked M. d'Harville,
in a tone of gloomy irony.</p>

<p>"Thank God, my lord, not a soul in the house has
the least suspicion of it!"</p>

<p>"No one suspects it," repeated M. d'Harville, despondingly;
"no one,&mdash;that's well, for her at least; well, let
us hope to keep the secret."</p>

<p>And, while Joseph was occupying himself in repairing
the havoc in his master's apartment, D'Harville walked
up to the stage of arms we before mentioned, examined
them with an expression of deep interest, then, turning
towards Joseph, with a sinister smile, said:</p>

<p>"I hope you have not omitted to clean the guns which
are placed at the top of the stand,&mdash;I mean those in my
hunting-case."</p>

<p>"I had not your lordship's orders to do so," replied
the astonished servant.</p>

<p>"You had, sir, and have neglected them!"</p>

<p>"I humbly assure you, my lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They must be in a fine state!"</p>

<p>"Your lordship will please to bear in mind that it is
scarcely a month since they were regularly repaired and
put in order for use by the gunsmith."</p>

<p>"Never mind! As soon as I am dressed reach down
my shooting-case; I will examine the guns myself. I
may very possibly go out shooting either to-morrow or
next day."</p>

<p>"I will reach them down directly, my lord."</p>

<p>The chamber being by this time replaced in its ordinary
state, a second <i>valet de chambre</i> was summoned to
assist Joseph.</p>

<p>His toilet concluded, M. d'Harville repaired to his
study, where the steward (M. Doublet) and his lawyer's
clerk were awaiting him.</p>

<p>"We have brought the agreement that my lord marquis
may hear it read over," said the bowing clerk; "my lord
will then only have to sign it, and the affair is concluded."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you perused it, M. Doublet?"</p>

<p>"I have, my lord, attentively."</p>

<p>"In that case I will affix my signature at once."</p>

<p>The necessary forms completed, the clerk withdrew,
when M. Doublet, rubbing his hands, and looking triumphantly,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now, then, by this last addition to your lordship's
estates, your manorial property cannot be less than a
hundred and twenty-six thousand francs per annum, in
round numbers. And permit me to say, my lord marquis,
that a rent-roll of a hundred and twenty-six thousand
francs per annum is of no common occurrence
nowadays."</p>

<p>"I am a happy man, am I not, M. Doublet? A hundred
and twenty-six thousand livres per annum! Surely
the man owning such an income must be blessed indeed,&mdash;sorrow
or care cannot reach him through so
golden a shield!"</p>

<p>"And that is wholly independent of my lord's funded
property, amounting at least to two millions more; or
reckoning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly; I know what you would say; without
reckoning my other blessings and comforts."</p>

<p>"Why, heaven be praised, your lordship is as rich in
all earthly blessings as in revenue. Not a precious gift
but it has been largely bestowed upon you; ay, and such
as even money will not buy: youth, uninterrupted health,
the power of enjoying every happiness, amongst which,
or, rather, at the head of which," said M. Doublet, gracefully
smiling, and gallantly bowing, "place that of being
the husband of so sweet a lady as Madame la Marquise,
and the parent of a lovely little girl, who might be mistaken
for a cherubim."</p>

<p>M. d'Harville cast a look of gloomy mistrust on the
poor steward; who, revelling in his own ecstasy at seeing
the princely rent-roll committed to his charge, exceeding
all others in magnificent amount, was far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
perceiving the scowling brow of his master, thus congratulated
on being the happiest man alive, when, to his
own view, a verier wretch, or more complete bankrupt
in happiness existed not. Striking M. Doublet familiarly
on the shoulder, and breaking into a wild, ironical laugh,
M. d'Harville rejoined:</p>

<p>"Then you think that with an income of two hundred
and sixty thousand livres, a wife like mine, and a
daughter resembling a cherubim, a man has nothing
more to wish for?"</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord," replied the steward, with honest
zeal, "you have still to wish for the blessing of lengthened
days, that you may be spared to see mademoiselle
married as happily as yourself. Ah, my lord, I may
not hope to see it, but I should be thankful to witness
you and my honoured lady surrounded by your grandchildren,&mdash;ay,
and great-grandchildren too,&mdash;why not?"</p>

<p>"Excellent, M. Doublet! A regular Baucis and Philemon
idea. You have always a capital illustration to
your ideas."</p>

<p>"You are too good to me, my lord. Has your lordship
any further orders for me?"</p>

<p>"None. Stay, though; what cash have you in
hand?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine thousand three hundred and odd
francs for current expenses, my lord marquis; but
there is a heavy sum at the bank belonging to this
quarter's income."</p>

<p>"Well, bring me twenty thousand francs in gold,
and, should I have gone out, give them to Joseph
for me."</p>

<p>"Does your lordship wish for them this morning?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Within an hour the gold shall be here. You have
nothing else to say to me, my lord?"</p>

<p>"No, M. Doublet."</p>

<p>"A hundred and twenty-six thousand francs per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
annum, wholly unincumbered," repeated the steward,
as he was about to quit the room; "this is a glorious
day for me to see; I almost feared at one time that we
should not secure this desirable property. Your lordship's
most humble servant, I take my leave."</p>

<p>"Good morning, M. Doublet."</p>

<p>As the door closed upon the steward, M. d'Harville,
overcome with the mental agony he had repressed thus
far, threw himself into an armchair, leaned his elbows
on the desk before which he sat, and covering his face
with his hands, for the first time since receiving the
fatal <i>billet</i>, gave vent to a flood of hot, burning
tears.</p>

<p>"Cruel mockery of fate!" cried he, at length, "to
have made me rich, but to have given me only shame
and dishonour to place within the gilded frame: the
perjury of Clémence, the disgrace which will descend
upon my innocent child. Can I suffer this? Or shall
I for the sake of her unoffending offspring spare the
guilty mother from the opprobrium of an exposure?"
Then rising suddenly from his seat, with sparkling eyes
and clenched teeth he cried, in a deep, determined
voice, "No, no! Blood, blood! The fearful protection
from laughter and derision. Ah, full well I
can now comprehend her coldness, her antipathy,
wretched, wretched woman!" Then, stopping all at
once, as though melted by some tender recollection,
he resumed, in a hoarse tone, "Aversion! Alas!
too well I know its cause. I inspire her with loathing,
with disgust!" Then, after a lengthened silence, he
cried, in a voice broken by sighs, "Yet, was it my
fault or my misfortune? Should she have wronged me
thus for a calamity beyond my power to avert? Surely
I am a more fitting object for her pity than scorn and
hatred." Again rekindling into his excited feelings, he
reiterated, "Nothing but blood&mdash;the blood of both&mdash;can
wash out this guilty stain! Doubtless he, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
favoured lover, has been informed why she flies her
husband's arms."</p>

<p>This latter thought redoubled the fury of the marquis.
He elevated his tightly compressed hands towards
heaven, as though invoking its vengeance; then, passing
his burning fingers over his eyes as he recollected
the necessity that existed for concealing his emotion
from the servants of his establishment, he returned to
his sleeping-apartment with an appearance of perfect
tranquillity. There he found Joseph.</p>

<p>"Well, in what state are the guns?"</p>

<p>"In perfect order. Please to examine them, my
lord."</p>

<p>"I came for the purpose of so doing. Has your lady
yet rung?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then inquire."</p>

<p>Directly the servant had quitted the room, M. d'Harville
hastily took from the gun-case a small powder-flask,
some balls and caps; then, locking the case, put
the key in his pocket. Then going to the stand of
arms, he took from it a pair of moderate-sized Manton's
pistols, loaded them, and placed them without difficulty
in the pockets of his morning wrapper. Joseph returned
with the intimation that Madame d'Harville was in her
dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Has your lady ordered her carriage?"</p>

<p>"My lord, I heard Mlle. Juliette say to the head-coachman,
when he came to inquire her ladyship's orders
for the day, that, 'as it was cold, dry walking, if her
ladyship went out at all, she would prefer going on foot.'"</p>

<p>"Very well. Stay,&mdash;I forgot. I shall not go out
hunting before to-morrow, or probably, next day.
Desire Williams to look the small travelling-britcska
carefully over. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my lord; it shall be attended to. Will
not your lordship require a stick?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Pray tell me, is there not a hackney coach-stand
near here?"</p>

<p>"Quite close, my lord,&mdash;in the Rue de Lille."</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, the marquis continued:
"Go and inquire of Mlle. Juliette whether Madame
d'Harville can see me for a few minutes." Joseph
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured the marquis, "I will see the cause
of all my misery,&mdash;my disgrace. I will contemplate
the guilty mask beneath which the impure heart conceals
its adulterous designs. I will listen to the false lips that
speak the words of innocence, while deep dishonour lurks
in the candid smile,&mdash;a smile that seemed to me as that
of an angel. Yet 'tis an appalling spectacle to watch
the words, the looks, of one who, breathing only the sentiments
of a chaste wife and mother, is about to sully
your name with one of those deep, deadly stains which
can only be washed out in blood. Fool that I am to
give her the chance of again bewildering my senses!
She will look at me with her accustomed sweetness and
candour; greet me (all guilty as she is) with the same
pure smile she bestows upon her child, as, kneeling at her
lap, it lisps its early prayer. That look,&mdash;those eyes, mirrors
of the soul,&mdash;the more modest and pure the glance"
(D'Harville shuddered with contempt) "the greater
must be the innate corruption and falsehood! Alas!
she has proved herself a consummate dissembler; and
I&mdash;I&mdash;have been the veriest dupe! Only let me consider
with what sentiments must that woman look upon
me, if just previous to her meeting with her favoured
lover I pay her my accustomed visit, and express my
usual devotion and love for her,&mdash;the young, the virtuous
wife, the tender, sensible, and devoted mother, as
until this wretched moment I would have died to prove
her. Can I, dare I, trust myself in her presence, with
the knowledge of her being but too impatient for the arrival
of that blessed hour which conveys her to her guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
rendezvous and infamous paramour? Oh, Clémence,
Clémence, you in whom all my hopes and fondest affections
were placed, is this a just return? No! no!
no!" again repeated M. d'Harville, with rapidly returning
excitement. "False, treacherous woman! I will
not see you! I will not trust my ears to your feigned
words! Nor you, my child. At the sight of your innocent
countenance I should unman myself, and compromise
my just revenge."</p>

<p>Quitting his apartment, M. d'Harville, instead of repairing
to those of the marquise, contented himself with
leaving a message for her through Mlle. Juliette, to the
effect that he wished a short conversation with Madame
d'Harville, but that being obliged to go out just then, he
should be glad, if it assorted with Madame la Marquise's
perfect convenience, to breakfast with her at twelve
o'clock.</p>

<p>"And so," said the unhappy M. d'Harville, "fancying
that after twelve o'clock I shall be safe at home, she
will consider herself more at liberty to follow out her
own plans."</p>

<p>He then repaired to the coach-stand contiguous to his
mansion, and summoned a vehicle from the ranks.</p>

<p>"Now, coachee," said he, affecting to disguise his
rank, "what's o'clock?"</p>

<p>"All right, master," said the man, drawing up to the
side of the footway, "where am I to drive to? Let's
have a right understanding, and a look at the clock.
Why, it's as close on half-after eleven as may be."</p>

<p>"Now, then, drive to the corner of the Rue St.
Dominique, and wait at the end of the garden wall
which runs along there; do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;I know."</p>

<p>M. d'Harville then drew down the blinds of the <i>fiacre</i>;
the coachman drove on, and soon arrived opposite the
Hôtel d'Harville, from which point of observation it
was impossible for any person to enter or quit the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
without the marquis having a full view of them. One
o'clock was the hour fixed in the note; and with his
eyes riveted on the entrance-gates of the mansion, the
marquis waited in painful suspense, absorbed in a whirl
of fearful thoughts and maddening conjectures. Time
stole on imperceptibly; twelve o'clock reverberated from
the dome of St. Thomas Aquinas, when the door opened
slowly at the Hôtel d'Harville, and Madame d'Harville
herself came timidly forth.</p>

<p>"Already?" exclaimed the unhappy husband; "how
punctual she is! She fears to keep him waiting," cried
the marquis, with a mixture of irony and savage rage.</p>

<p>The cold was excessive; the pavement hard and dry.
Clémence was dressed in a black velvet bonnet, covered
with a veil of the same colour, and a thickly wadded
pelisse of dark ruby satin, a large shawl of dark blue
cashmere fell to the very hem of her pelisse, which she
lightly and gracefully held up while crossing the street.
Thanks to this movement, the taper foot and graceful
ankle of Madame d'Harville, cased in an exquisitely
fitting boot of black satin, were exposed to view.</p>

<p>It was strange, that amid the painful and bewildering
ideas that crowded the brain of D'Harville, he should
have found one thought to waste upon the beauty of his
wife's foot; but so it was; and at the moment that was
about to separate them for ever, to his eager gaze that
fairy foot and well-turned ankle had never looked so
charming; and then, as by a rapid train of thought he
recalled the matchless loveliness of his wife, and, as
he had ever believed till now, her purity, her mental
graces, he groaned aloud as he remembered that another
was preferred to him, and that the light figure that
glided on before his fixed gaze, was but the hollow
spectre of fallen goodness, a lost, degraded creature, hastening
to steep her husband and infant in irremediable
disgrace, for the indulging of a base and guilty passion.
Even in that wretched moment he felt how dearly, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
exclusively he had loved her; and for the first time during
the blow which had fallen on him, he knew that he
mourned the lovely woman almost equally with the
virtuous mother and chaste wife. A cry of rage and
mingled fury escaped him, as he pictured the rapture of
her meeting with the lover of her choice; and a sharp,
darting pain quivered through his heart as he remembered
that Clémence, with all her youth and beauty, her
countless charms, both of body and mind, was lost to
him for ever.</p>

<p>Hitherto his passionate grief had been unmixed by
any alloy of self. He had bewailed the sanctity of the
marriage-vow trampled under foot, the abandonment of
all sworn and sacred duties; but his sufferings of rage,
jealousy, and regret almost overpowered him, and with
much difficulty was he able to command his voice sufficiently
to say to the coachman, while partially drawing
up the blind:</p>

<p>"Do you see that lady in the blue shawl and black
bonnet walking along by the wall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I see her safe enough."</p>

<p>"Well, then, go slowly along, and keep up with her.
Should she go to the coach-stand I had you from,
pull up; and when she has got into a <i>fiacre</i>, follow it
wherever it goes."</p>

<p>"All right,&mdash;I understand! Now this is what I call
a good joke!"</p>

<p>M. d'Harville had conjectured rightly. Madame
d'Harville repaired directly to the coach-stand, and
beckoning a <i>fiacre</i> off the stand, instantly got in, and
drove off, closely followed by the vehicle containing
her husband.</p>

<p>They had proceeded but a very short distance, when
the coachman took the road to the church of St. Thomas
Aquinas, and, to the surprise of M. d'Harville, pulled
up directly in front.</p>

<p>"What is this for? What are you about?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, master, the lady you told me to follow has
just alighted here, and a smart, tidy leg and foot of her
own she has got. Her dress somehow caught; so, you
see, I couldn't help having a peep, nohow. This is
downright good fun though, this is!"</p>

<p>A thousand varied thoughts agitated M. d'Harville.
One minute he fancied that his wife, fearing pursuit, had
taken this step to escape detection; then hope whispered
that the letter which had given him so much uneasiness,
might after all be only an infamous calumny; for if
guilty, what could be gained by this false assumption
of piety? Would it not be a species of sacrilegious
mockery? At this suggestion a bright ray of hope shot
across the troubled mind of M. d'Harville, arising from
the striking contrast between Clémence's present occupation
and the crime alleged as her motive for quitting
her home. Alas! this consolatory illusion was speedily
destroyed. Leaning in at the open window the coachman
observed:</p>

<p>"I say, master, that nice little woman you are after
has got back into her coach."</p>

<p>"Then follow quickly."</p>

<p>"I'm off! Now this is what I call downright good
fun. Capital; hang me if it ain't!"</p>

<p>The vehicle reached the Quais, the Hôtel de Ville, the
Rue St. Avoye, and, at last, Rue du Temple.</p>

<p>"I say," said the coachman, turning round to speak to
M. d'Harville from his seat, "master, just look. My
mate, there, has stopped at No. 17; we are about at 13.
Shall I stop here or go on to 17?"</p>

<p>"Stop here."</p>

<p>"I say,&mdash;look'ee,&mdash;you'll lose your pretty lady. She
has gone into the alley leading to No. 17."</p>

<p>"Open the door."</p>

<p>"I'm coming, sir."</p>

<p>And quickly following the steps of his wife, M.
d'Harville entered the obscure passage up which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
had disappeared. Madame d'Harville, however, had so
far the start as to have entered the house previously.</p>

<p>Attracted by the most devouring curiosity, Madame
Pipelet, with her melancholy Alfred and her friend the
oyster-woman, were huddled close together on the sill at
the lodge door. The staircase was so dark that a person
just emerging from the daylight into the gloom of the
passage could not discern a single step of it; and
Madame d'Harville, agitated and almost sinking with
apprehension, found herself constrained to apply to
Madame Pipelet for further advice how to proceed,
saying, in a low, tremulous voice:</p>

<p>"Which way must I turn, madame, to find the staircase
of the house?"</p>

<p>"Stop, if you please. Pray, whom do you want?"</p>

<p>"I wish to go to the apartments of M. Charles,
madame."</p>

<p>"Monsieur who?" repeated the old woman, feigning
not to have heard her, but in reality to afford sufficient
leisure to her husband and her friend thoroughly
to scrutinise the unhappy woman's countenance, even
through the folds of her thick veil.</p>

<p>"M. Charles, madame," repeated Clémence, in a low,
trembling tone, and bending down her head, so as to
escape the rude and insolent examination to which her
features were subjected.</p>

<p>"Ah! M. Charles; very well; you should have spoken
so that one could hear you. Well, my pretty dear, if
you want M. Charles,&mdash;and a good-looking fellow he is
as ever won a woman's heart,&mdash;go straight on, and the
door will stare you in the face. Eh! eh! eh!" laughed
out the old woman, shaking her fat sides with spiteful
glee, "it seems he has not waited for nothing this time.
Success to love and love-makings, and a merry end to
it!"</p>

<p>The marquise, ready to sink with confusion, began
slowly to grope her way up the dingy staircase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say," bawled out the old shell-fish woman, "our
commandant knows what he is about, don't he? Leave
him alone to choose a pretty girl. His marm is a
regular swell, ain't she?"</p>

<p>Had it not been requisite for her to run the gauntlet
of the trio who occupied the entrance-door, Madame
d'Harville, ready to sink with shame and terror, would
gladly have retraced her steps. She made another effort,
and at last reached the landing-place, where, to her
unutterable consternation and surprise, she saw Rodolph
waiting, impatiently, her arrival. Instantly flying to
meet her, he hastily placed a purse in her hand, saying,
in a hurried manner:</p>

<p>"Your husband knows all, and is now following your
very steps."</p>

<p>At this instant, the sharp tones of Madame Pipelet
were heard crying out, "Where are you going to, sir?"</p>

<p>"'Tis he!" exclaimed Rodolph, and then, almost
forcing Madame d'Harville up the second staircase, he
added, in a rapid manner, "make all haste to the very
top of the house; on the fifth floor you will find a
wretched family, named Morel. Remember your sole
business in coming hither was to relieve their distress."</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir," screamed Madame Pipelet, "that
unless you tell me your name, you shall trample over
me, as they walked over our brave men at Waterloo,
before I let you pass."</p>

<p>Having, from the entrance to the alley, observed
Madame d'Harville stop to speak to the porteress, the
marquis had likewise prepared himself to pass through
some sort of questioning.</p>

<p>"I belong to the lady who just now entered," said the
marquis.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed Madame Pipelet, looking the
picture of wonderment, "why, that, of course, is a satisfactory
answer. You can pass on, if you please."</p>

<p>Hearing an unusual stir, M. Charles Robert had set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the door of his apartments ajar, and Rodolph, unwilling
to be recognised by M. d'Harville, whose quick, searching
eye might have detected him, spite of the murkiness
of the staircase, hearing him rapidly ascending the stairs,
just as he reached the landing-place, dashed into the
chamber of the astonished commandant, locking the door
after him. M. Charles Robert, magnificently attired in
his <i>robe de chambre</i> of scarlet damask with orange-coloured
stripes, and Greek cap of embroidered velvet,
was struck with astonishment at the unexpected appearance
of Rodolph, whom he had not seen the preceding
evening at the embassy, and who was upon the present
occasion very plainly dressed.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion?" asked he
at length, assuming a tone of killing haughtiness.</p>

<p>"Be silent!" replied Rodolph; and there was that in
his voice and manner that Charles Robert obeyed, even
in spite of his own determination to strike terror into
the bold invader of his private moments.</p>

<p>A violent and continued noise, as of some heavy
substance falling from one stair to the other, resounded
through the dull silence of the gloomy staircase.</p>

<p>"Unhappy man! He has murdered her!" exclaimed
Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Murdered!" ejaculated M. Charles Robert, turning
very pale; "for the love of Heaven, what is all this
about?"</p>

<p>But, without heeding his inquiry, Rodolph partially
opened the door, and discovered little Tortillard half
rolling, half limping, down the stairs, holding in his
hand the red silk purse Rodolph had just given to
Madame d'Harville. Tortillard, with another scrambling
shuffle, disappeared at the bottom of the last
flight of stairs. The light step of Madame d'Harville,
and the heavier tread of her husband, as he continued
his pursuit of her from one story to another, could be
distinctly heard. Somewhat relieved of his worst fears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
yet unable to make out by what chance the purse so
recently committed to Madame d'Harville's hands should
have been transferred to those of Tortillard, Rodolph
said, authoritatively, to M. Robert:</p>

<p>"Do not think of quitting your apartments for the
next hour, I request!"</p>

<p>"Upon my life and soul, that is a pretty thing to say
to a gentleman in his own house," replied M. Robert in
an impatient and wrathful tone. "I ask you, again,
what is the meaning of all this? Who the devil are
you, sir? And how dare you dictate to me, a
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"M. d'Harville is informed of everything,&mdash;has followed
his wife to your very door,&mdash;and is now pursuing
her to the upper part of the house."</p>

<p>"God bless me! Here's a situation!" exclaimed
Charles Robert, with an appearance of utter consternation.
"But what is to be done? What is the
use of her going up-stairs? And how will she manage
to get down again unobserved?"</p>

<p>"Remain where you are, neither speak nor move
until the porteress comes to you," rejoined Rodolph,
who hastened to give his final instructions to Madame
Pipelet, leaving the commandant a prey to the most
alarming apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" cried Madame Pipelet, her face
radiant with chuckling exultation; "there's rare sport
going on! The lady who came to visit my fine gentleman
on the first floor has been followed by another
gentleman, who seems rather in a passion,&mdash;the
husband of that silly young creature, I make no
doubt. Directly the truth flashed across me, I tells
him to go straight up; for, thinks I, he'll be sure to
murder our commandant. That'll make a deal of talk
in the neighbourhood; and folks will come crowding to
see the house, just as they did at No. 36 after the man
was killed there. Lord! I wonder the fighting has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
begun yet. I have been listening to hear them set to;
but I can't catch the least sound."</p>

<p>"My dear Madame Pipelet, will you do me a great
favour?" said Rodolph, putting five louis into her hand.
"When this lady comes down-stairs, ask her how she
found the poor Morels. Tell her she has performed an
act of real charity in coming to see them, according to
her promise, the last time she called to inquire respecting
them."</p>

<p>Madame Pipelet looked first at the money and then at
Rodolph, with an air of petrified astonishment.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with this money?" inquired she,
at length; "do you give it to me? Ah, I see! This
handsome lady, then, does not come altogether for the
commandant?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman who followed her was her husband,
as you justly supposed; but, being warned in time, the
poor lady went straight on to the Morels, as though her
only business here was to afford them succour. Now do
you understand!"</p>

<p>"I should think I did,&mdash;clear as noonday. 'A nod
is as good as a wink,' as the old woman said. I know!
You want me to help you cheat the husband? Lord
bless you! I'm up to all those things,&mdash;quick as
lightning, silent as the grave! Go along with you!
I'm a regular good hand at keeping husbands in the
dark; you might fancy I'd been used to it all my life.
But tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The huge hat of M. Pipelet was here observed sending
its dark shadow across the floor of the lodge.</p>

<p>"Anastasie," said Alfred, gravely, "you are like M.
César Bradamanti; you have no respect for anything
or anybody. And let me tell you that there are subjects
that should never be made the subject of a jest,
even amongst the most familiar acquaintances."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my old darling. Don't stand there rolling
up your eyes, and looking about as wise as a pig in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
pound. You know well enough I was only joking; you
know well enough that no living soul beneath the canopy
of heaven can ever say I gave him a liberty. But
that'll do; so let's talk of this good gentleman's business.
Suppose I do go out of my usual way to save
this young lady, I'm sure I do it solely to oblige our
new lodger, who, for his generosity, may well deserve to
be called the king of lodgers." Then, turning towards
Rodolph, she added, "You shall see how cleverly I will
go to work. Just hide yourself there in that corner
behind the curtain. Quick,&mdash;quick! I hear them
coming."</p>

<p>Rodolph had scarcely time to conceal himself ere
M. and Madame d'Harville descended the stairs. The
features of the marquis shone with happiness, mingled
with a confused and astonished expression, while the
countenance of his wife, as she hung on his arm, looked
calm but pale.</p>

<p>"Well, my good lady," cried Madame Pipelet, going
out of her lodge to address her, as she descended the
last stair, "how did you find the poor creatures,&mdash;I
mean the Morels? Ah, I doubt not, such a sight made
your heart ache? God knows your charity was well
bestowed! I told you the other day, when you called
to inquire about them, what a state of starvation and
misery they were in. Be assured, kind lady, these poor
things are fit objects of your bounty; you will never
have to regret coming to this out-of-the-way place to
examine into their case. They really are deserving all
your kindness,&mdash;don't you think so, Alfred?"</p>

<p>Alfred, the strictness of whose ideas touching a due
regard for all conjugal duties made him revolt at the
thoughts of helping to deceive a husband, replied only
by a sort of grumbling sound, as vague as discordant.</p>

<p>"Please to excuse my husband, madame," resumed
Madame Pipelet; "he has got the cramp in his stomach,
and cannot speak loud enough to be understood, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
he would tell you as well as myself that the poor people
you have so fortunately relieved will pray of the Almighty,
night and day, to bless and reward you, my
worthy lady."</p>

<p>M. d'Harville gazed on his wife with feelings approaching
to adoration, as he exclaimed, "Angel of goodness,
how has base slander dared to disturb your heavenly
work!"</p>

<p>"An angel!" repeated Madame Pipelet; "that she is,
and one of the very best heaven could send. There is
not a better."</p>

<p>"Let us return home, I entreat!" said Madame
d'Harville, who was suffering acutely under the restraint
she had put upon herself since entering the house, and,
now that the necessity for exertion was over, found her
strength rapidly forsaking her.</p>

<p>"Instantly," replied the marquis.</p>

<p>At the instant of their emerging into the open air from
the obscurity of the alley, M. d'Harville, observing the
pale looks of his wife, said, tenderly:</p>

<p>"Ah, Clémence, I have deep cause to solicit your pity
and forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Alas! my lord," said the marquise, sighing deeply,
"which of us has not need of pardon?"</p>

<p>Rodolph quitted his hiding-place, deeply ruminating
upon so terrible a scene, thus intermingled with absurdity
and coarseness, and pondering over the curious termination
to a drama, the commencement of which had
called forth such different passions.</p>

<p>"Well, now," exclaimed Madame Pipelet, "you must
say I played my part well. Didn't I send that donkey
of a husband home with longer ears than he came out
with? Lord bless you! he'll put his wife under a glass
case, and worship her from this day forward. Poor,
dear gentleman! I really could not help feeling sorry
for him. Oh! but about your furniture, M. Rodolph; it
has not come yet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am now going to see about it. By the by, you
had better go and inform the commandant that he may
venture out."</p>

<p>"True; I'll go and let the caged bird out. But what
stuff and nonsense for him to hire apartments of no
more use to him than they are to the King of Prussia!
He is a fine fellow, he is, with his paltry twelve francs
a month. This is the fourth time he has been made a
fool of."</p>

<p>Rodolph quitted the house, and Madame Pipelet, turning
to her husband, said, with a chuckling laugh, "Now,
Alfred, the commandant's turn has come; now for it!
I mean to have a jolly good laugh at my gentleman,&mdash;up
and dressed for nothing."</p>

<p>Arrived at the apartments of M. Charles Robert, the
porteress rang the bell; the door was opened by the
commandant himself.</p>

<p>"Commandant," said Anastasie, giving him a military
salute, by placing the back of her little fat hand against
the front of her wig, "I have come to set you free. Your
friends have gone away arm in arm, happy as doves,
under your very nose. Well, you are out of a nice mess,
thanks to M. Rodolph. You ought to stand something
very handsome to him for all he has done upon the present
occasion."</p>

<p>"Then this slim individual with the moustachios is
called M. Rodolph, is he?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so; neither more nor less."</p>

<p>"And who and what is the fellow?"</p>

<p>"Fellow, indeed!" cried Madame Pipelet, in a wrathful
voice; "he is as good as other men,&mdash;better than
some I could mention. Why, he is a travelling clerk,
but the very king of lodgers; for, though he has only
one room, he does not haggle and beat folks down,&mdash;not
he. Why, he gave me six francs for doing for him,&mdash;six
francs, mind, I say, without a word. Think of
that!&mdash;without ever offering me a sou less. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
he is a lodger! I wish other people were at all like
him!"</p>

<p>"There, there, that's enough; take the key."</p>

<p>"Shall I light the fire to-morrow, commandant?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Next day?"</p>

<p>"No, no! Don't bother me."</p>

<p>"I say, commandant, if you recollect, I warned you
that you would have your trouble for your pains."</p>

<p>M. Charles Robert threw a glance at his grinning
tormentor that spoke of annihilation at least, and, dashing
furiously by her, quitted the house, wondering much
how a mere clerk should have become acquainted with
his assignation with the Marquise d'Harville.</p>

<p>As the commandant left the alley, Tortillard came
hobbling along.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" said Madame Pipelet.</p>

<p>"Has the Borgnesse been to call upon me?" asked
the young scamp, without attending to the porteress's
question.</p>

<p>"The Chouette? No, you ugly monster! What
should she come for?"</p>

<p>"Why, to take me with her into the country, to be
sure," said Tortillard, swinging on the lodge gate.</p>

<p>"And what does your master say to it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, father managed all that. He sent this
morning to M. Bradamanti, to ask him to give me leave
to go in the country,&mdash;the country,&mdash;the country,"
sang or rather screamed the amiable scion of M. Bras
Rouge, beating time most melodiously on the window-panes.</p>

<p>"Will you leave off, you young rascal, or are
you going to break my window? Oh, here comes a
coach!"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" shrieked the urchin; "it is my dear
Chouette! Oh, how nice the ride in a coach!"</p>

<p>And, looking through the window, they saw reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
upon the red blind of the opposite glass the hideous profile
of the Borgnesse. She beckoned to Tortillard, who
ran out to her. The coachman descended from his box,
and opened the door; Tortillard sprang into the vehicle,
which instantly drove off.</p>

<p>Another person beside the Chouette was in the carriage.
In the farther corner, and wrapped in an old
cloak with a furred collar, his features shrouded by a
black silk cap pulled down over his brows, sat the
Schoolmaster. His inflamed lids formed a horrible
contrast with the white globeless space beneath; and
this fearful spectacle was rendered still more hideous
by the action of the severe cold upon his seamed and
frightful countenance.</p>

<p>"Now, small boy, squat yourself down on the pins of
my man; you'll serve to keep him warm," said the Borgnesse
to Tortillard, who crouched like a dog close to the
feet of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette.</p>

<p>"Now, then, my coves," said the driver, "on we go to
the 'ken' at Bouqueval, don't we, La Chouette? You
shall see whether I can 'tool a drag' or not."</p>

<p>"And keep your pads on the move, my fine fellow;
for we must get hold of the girl to-night."</p>

<p>"All right, my blind un; we'll go the pace."</p>

<p>"Shall I give you a hint?" said the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Why, cut it fine as you pass by the 'nabs' at the
barrier; the meeting might lead to disagreeable recollections.
It is not every old acquaintance it is worth
while to renew our friendship with. You have been
wanted at the barriers for some time."</p>

<p>"I'll keep my weather-eye open," replied the driver,
getting on his box.</p>

<p>It needs scarcely be told, after this specimen of slang,
that the coachman was a robber, one of the Schoolmaster's
worthy associates. The vehicle then quitted the Rue du
Temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours afterwards, towards the closing of a winter's
day, the vehicle containing the Chouette, the Schoolmaster,
and Tortillard, stopped before a wooden cross,
marking out the sunken and lonely road which conducted
to the farm at Bouqueval, where the Goualeuse remained
under the kind protection of Madame Georges.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h5>AN IDYL.</h5>


<p>The hour of five had just struck from the church clock
of the little village of Bouqueval; the cold was intense,
the sky clear, the sun, sinking slowly behind the vast
leafless woods which crowned the heights of Ecouen,
cast a purple hue over the horizon, and sent its faint,
sloping rays across the extensive plains, white and hard
with winter's frost.</p>

<p>In the country each season has its own distinctive
features, its own peculiar charm; at times the dazzling
snow changes the whole scene into immense landscapes
of purest alabaster, exhibiting their spotless beauties to
the reddish gray of the sky. Then may be seen in the
glimmer of twilight, either ascending or descending the
hill, a benighted farmer returning to his habitation; his
horse, cloak, and hat, are covered with the falling snow.
Bitter is the cold, biting the north wind, dark and
gloomy the approaching night; but what cares he?
There, amid those leafless trees, he sees the bright taper
burning in the window of his cheerful home; while from
the tall chimney a column of dark smoke rolls upwards
through the flaky shower that descends, and speaks to
the toil-worn farmer of a blazing hearth and humble
meal prepared by kind affection to welcome him after
the fatigues of his journey. Then the rustic gossip by
the fireside, on which the fagot burns and crackles, and
a peaceful, comfortable night's rest, amid the whistling
of the winds, and the barking of the various dogs at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
different farms scattered around, with the answering cry
from the distant watch-dog.</p>

<p>Daylight opens upon a scene of fairy-land. Surely
the tiny elves have been celebrating some grand fête,
and have left some of their adornments behind them, for
on each branch hang long spiracles of crystal, glittering
in the rays of a winter's sun with all the prismatic brilliancy
of the diamond. The damp, rich soil of the
arable land is laid down in furrows, where hides the
timid hare in her form, or the speckled partridge runs
merrily. Here and there is heard the melancholy tinkling
of the sheep-bell hanging from the neck of some
important leader of the numerous flocks scattered over
the verdant heights and turfy valleys of the neighbourhood;
while, carefully wrapped in his dark gray cloak,
the shepherd, seated under shelter of those knotted
trunks and interlaced branches, chants his cheerful lay,
while his fingers are busily employed weaving a basket
of rushes.</p>

<p>Occasionally a more animated scene presents itself;
distant echo gives out the faint sound of the hunting-horn,
and the cry of hounds; suddenly a frightened deer
bursts from the neighbouring forest, stands for a few
seconds in terrified alarm upon the frozen plain, then
darts onward, and is quickly lost amid the thickets on
the opposite side. The trampling of horses, the barking
of dogs, are rapidly brought nearer by the breeze; and now,
in their turn, a pack of dogs with brown and tawny-spotted
skins issue from the brushwood from which the
frightened deer but just now came; they run eagerly
over the sterile ground, the fallow fields, with noses
closely pointed to the ground they pursue with loud cries
the traces left by the flying deer. At their heels come
the hunters in their scarlet coats, bending over the necks
of their swift steeds; they encourage their dogs by their
voices mingled with the notes of the horn. Swift as
lightning the brilliant cortège passes on; the noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
decreases; by degrees all is still; dogs, horses, and
huntsmen are lost in the tangled mazes of the forest,
where the frightened stag had sought and found a hiding-place.
Then peace and calm resumed their reign;
and the profound stillness of these vast plains was interrupted
only by the monotonous song of the shepherd.</p>

<p>These sights,&mdash;these rustic views abounded in the
environs of the village of Bouqueval, which, spite of its
proximity to Paris, was situated in a sort of desert, to
which there was no approach except by cross-roads.
Concealed during the summer among the trees, like
a nest amid the sheltering foliage, the farm which had
become the home of the poor Goualeuse was now utterly
bereft of its leafy screen, and entirely exposed to view.
The course of the little river, now quite frozen over,
resembled a long silver riband stretched along the
ever verdant meadows, through which a number of fine
cows were leisurely wending their way to their stable.
Brought home by the approach of night, flocks of pigeons
were successively arriving, and perching on the peaked
roof of the dove-house; while the immense walnut-tree,
that during the summer afforded an umbrageous screen
both to the farmhouse and its numerous out-buildings,
stripped of its rich foliage, exhibited only bare branches,
through which could plainly be discerned the tiled roof
of the one, and the thatched tops of the others, overgrown
with patches of moss of mingled green and dingy
brown.</p>

<p>A heavy cart, drawn by three strong, sturdy horses,
with long, thick manes and shining coats, with blue collars
ornamented with bells and tassels of red worsted,
was bringing in a load of wheat from a neighbouring
rick. This ponderous machine entered the courtyard
by the large gate, while immense flocks of sheep were
pressing eagerly round the side entrances; both men
and beasts appeared impatient to escape from the severity
of the cold, and to enjoy the comfort of repose. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
horses neighed joyously at the sight of their stable, the
sheep bleated their satisfaction at returning to their
warm folds, while the hungry labourers cast a longing
look towards the kitchen windows, from which streamed
forth pleasant promise of a warm and savoury meal.</p>

<p>The whole of the exterior arrangements of the farm
were indicative of the most scrupulous order, neatness,
and exactitude. Instead of being covered with dirt and
dust, scattered about, and exposed to the inclemency of
the season, the carts, rollers, harrows, etc., with every
agricultural implement (and some were of the last and
best invention), were placed, well cleaned and painted,
under a vast shed, where the carters were accustomed to
arrange their cart-harness with the most symmetrical
attention to order and method. Large, clean, and well
laid out, the court-yard had none of those huge dung-heaps,
those stagnant pools of filthy water, which deface
the finest establishments of La Beauce or La Brie.</p>

<p>The poultry-yard, surrounded by a green trellising,
received and shut in all the feathered tribe, who after
wandering in the fields all day, returned home by a small
door left open till all were collected, when it was carefully
closed and secured. Without dwelling too minutely
upon every detail, we shall merely observe, that in all
respects this farm passed most justly in the environs for
a model farm, as much for the excellency of the method
by which it was conducted, and the abundant crops it
produced, as for the respectability and correct mode of
life which distinguished the various labourers employed
there, who were soon ranked among the most creditable
and efficient workmen of the place.</p>

<p>The cause of all this prosperity shall be spoken of
hereafter. Meanwhile we will conduct the reader to the
trellised gate of the poultry-yard, which, for the rustic
elegance of its perches and poultry-houses, was noways
inferior to the farm itself; while through the centre
flowed a small stream of clear, limpid water, the bed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which was laid down with smooth pebbles, carefully
cleansed from any obstructing substance.</p>

<p>A sudden stir arose among the winged inhabitants of
this charming spot; the fowls flew fluttering and cackling
from their perches, the turkeys gabbled, the guinea-fowls
screamed, and the pigeons, forsaking their elevated
position on the summit of the dove-house, descended to
the sandy surface of the yard, and stood cooing and
caressing each other with every manifestation of joy.
The arrival of Fleur-de-Marie had occasioned all these
ecstatic delights.</p>

<p>A more charming model than the Goualeuse could
not have been desired by Greuze or Watteau, had her
cheeks possessed a little more <i>rondeur</i> or been visited by
a brighter tinge; but, spite of their delicate paleness,
the expression of her features, the <i>tout ensemble</i> of her
figure, and the gracefulness of her attitude would have
rendered her worthy of exercising the crayons of even
the celebrated artists we have alluded to.</p>

<p>The small round cap of Fleur-de-Marie displayed her
fair forehead and light, braided hair, in common with
all the young girls in the environs of Paris; above this
cap, but still exposing the crown and ears, she wore a
large red cotton handkerchief, folded smoothly, and
pinned behind her head; while the long ends waving
gracefully over her shoulders formed a costume which,
for graceful effect, might be envied by the tasteful <i>coiffeurs</i>
of Italy or Switzerland. A handkerchief of snow-white
linen, crossed over her bosom, was half concealed by the
high and spreading front of her coarse cloth apron. A
jacket of blue woollen cloth with tight sleeves displayed
her slender figure, and descended half way down her
thick skirt of dark-striped fustian; white cotton stockings
and tied shoes, partly covered by sabots, furnished
with a leather strap for the instep, completed this costume
of rustic simplicity, to which the natural grace of
Fleur-de-Marie lent an inexpressible charm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding in one hand the two corners of her apron,
with the other she distributed handfuls of grain among
the winged crowd by which she was surrounded. One
beautiful pigeon of a silvery whiteness, with beak and
feet of a rich purple colour, more presuming or more
indulged than the rest, after having flown several times
around Fleur-de-Marie, at length alighted on her shoulder;
the young girl, as though well used to these
familiarities, continued, wholly undisturbed, to throw
out continued supplies of grain; but, half turning her
head till its perfect outline alone was visible, she gently
raised her head, and smilingly offered her small rosy
lips to meet those of her fond, caressing friend. The
last rays of the setting sun shed a pale golden light over
this innocent picture.</p>

<p>While the Goualeuse was thus occupied with her rural
cares, Madame Georges and the Abbé Laporte, curé of
Bouqueval, sitting by the fireside in the neat little parlour
of the farm, were conversing on the one constant
theme,&mdash;Fleur-de-Marie. The old curé, with a pensive,
thoughtful air, his head bent downwards, and his elbows
leaning on his knees, mechanically stretched his two
trembling hands before the fire. Madame Georges, laying
aside the needlework on which she had been occupied, kept
an anxious eye on the abbé, as though eagerly waiting for
some observation from him. After a moment's silence:</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "you are right, Madame Georges; it
will be better for M. Rodolph to question Marie, for she
is so filled with deep gratitude and devotion to him, that
she will probably reveal to him what she persists in
concealing from us."</p>

<p>"Then, since you agree with me, M. le Curé, I will
write, this very evening, to the address he left with me,&mdash;the
Allée des Veuves."</p>

<p>"Poor child," sighed the kind old man, "she ought
to have been so happy here! What secret grief can thus
be preying on her mind?"</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;<i>At Length Alighted on Her Shoulder</i>&quot;<br />
<span class="artist">Original Etching by L. Poiteau</span></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her unhappiness is too deeply fixed to be removed
even by her earnest and passionate application to study."</p>

<p>"And yet she has made a most rapid and extraordinary
progress since she has been under our care,
has she not?"</p>

<p>"She has, indeed; already she can read and write
with the utmost fluency, and is already sufficiently
advanced in arithmetic to assist me in keeping my
farm accounts; and then the dear child is so active
and industrious, and really affords me so much assistance
as both surprises me and moves me to tears. You
know that, spite of my repeated remonstrances, she persisted
in working so hard, that I became quite alarmed
lest such toil should seriously affect her health."</p>

<p>"I am thankful to hear from you," resumed the
worthy curé, "that your negro doctor has fully quieted
your apprehensions respecting the cough your young
friend suffered from; he says it is merely temporary,
and gives no reason for uneasiness."</p>

<p>"Oh, that kind, excellent M. David! He really appeared
to feel the same interest in the poor girl that
we did who know her sad story. She is universally
beloved and respected by all on the farm; though that
is not surprising, as, thanks to the generous and elevated
views of M. Rodolph, all the persons employed on it are
selected for their good sense and excellent conduct, from
all parts of the kingdom; but were it not so,&mdash;were they
of the common herd of vulgar-minded labourers, they
could not help feeling the influence of Marie's angelic
sweetness, and timid, graceful manner, as though she
were always deprecating anger, or beseeching pardon
for some involuntary fault. Unfortunate being! as
though she alone were to blame."</p>

<p>After remaining for several minutes buried in reflection,
the abbé resumed:</p>

<p>"Did you not tell me that this deep dejection of
Marie's might be dated from the time when Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Dubreuil, who rents under the Duke de Lucenay, paid
her a visit during the feast of the Holy Ghost?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. le Curé, I did. And yet Madame Dubreuil
and her daughter Clara (a perfect model of candour and
goodness) were as much taken with our dear child as
every one else who approaches her; and both of them
lavished on her every mark of the most affectionate
regard. You know that we pass the Sunday alternately
at each other's house; but it invariably happens that,
when we return from our Sunday excursion to Arnouville,
where Madame Dubreuil and her daughter reside,
the melancholy of my dear Marie seems augmented, and
her spirits more depressed than ever. I cannot comprehend
why this should be, when Madame Dubreuil treats
her like a second daughter, and the sweet Clara loves
her with the tender affection of a sister."</p>

<p>"In truth, Madame Georges, it is a fearful mystery;
what can occasion all this hidden sorrow, when here she
need not have a single care? The difference between
her present and past life must be as great as that which
exists between heaven and the abode of the damned.
Surely, hers is not an ungrateful disposition?"</p>

<p>"She ungrateful! Oh, no, M. le Curé! her sensitive
and affectionate nature magnifies the slightest service
rendered her, and she appears as though her gratitude
could never be sufficiently evinced. There is, too, in
her every thought an instinctive delicacy and fineness of
feeling wholly incompatible with ingratitude, which could
never be harboured in so noble a nature as that of my
charge. Dear Marie, how anxious does she seem to earn
the bread she eats, and how eagerly she strives to compensate
the hospitality shown her, by every exertion she
can make, or service she can render! And, then, except
on Sunday, when I make it a point she should dress
herself with more regard to appearance to accompany
me to church, she will only wear the coarse, humble garments
worn by our young peasant girls; and yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
is in her such an air of native superiority, so natural a
grace, that one would not desire to see her otherwise
attired, would they, M. le Curé?"</p>

<p>"Ah, mother's pride! Beware!" said the old priest,
smiling.</p>

<p>At these words, tears filled the eyes of Madame
Georges; she thought of her long-lost child, and of
his possible destiny.</p>

<p>"Come, come, dear friend, cheer up! Look upon our
dear Marie as sent by a gracious Providence to occupy
your maternal affections until the blessed moment when
he shall restore you your son; and, besides, you have a
sacred duty to perform towards this child of your adoption.
Are you not her baptismal godmother? And, believe
me, when that office is worthily discharged, it almost
equals that of a mother. As for M. Rodolph, he has
discharged his obligation of godfather by anticipation,
for, in snatching her from the abyss of crime into which
her misfortunes and her helplessness had cast her, he
may be said to have caused her immortal existence
to begin."</p>

<p>"Doubtless the poor thing has never received the
sacrament of our holy church. Do you think, M. le Curé,
she is now sufficiently acquainted with its sanctified
purposes to be admitted to a participation of it?"</p>

<p>"I will take an opportunity of learning her sentiments
on the subject as we walk back to the rectory. I
shall then apprise her that the holy ceremony will take
place probably in about a fortnight from hence."</p>

<p>"How gratefully she will receive such an information;
her religious feelings are the strongest I have ever
met with."</p>

<p>"Alas, poor thing! she has deep and heavy expiation
to make for the errors of her past life."</p>

<p>"Nay, M. l'Abbé, consider. Abandoned so young,
without resource, without friends, almost without a knowledge
of good or evil, plunged involuntarily into the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
vortex of crime, what was there to prevent her from
falling the bitter sacrifice she has been?"</p>

<p>"The clear, moral sense of right and wrong implanted
by the Creator in every breast should have withheld
her; and, besides, we have no evidence of her having
even sought to escape from the horrible fate into which
she had fallen. Is there no friendly hand to be found
in Paris to listen to the cries of suffering virtue? Is
charity so rare, so hard to obtain in that large city?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope not, M. l'Abbé; but how to discover it
is the difficulty. Ere arriving at the knowledge of one
kind, commiserating Christian, think of the refusals,
the rebukes, the denials to be endured. And, then, in
such a case as our poor Marie's, it was no passing
temporary aid that could avail her, but the steady,
continued patronage and support, the being placed in
the way to earn an honest livelihood. Many tender and
pitying mothers would have succoured her had they
known her sad case, I doubt not, but it was first requisite
to secure the happiness of knowing where to meet
with them. Trust me, I, too, have known want and
misery. But for one of those providential chances
which, alas! too late, threw poor Marie in the way of
M. Rodolph,&mdash;but for one of those casualties, the
wretched and destitute, most commonly repulsed with
rude denial on their first applications, believe pity irretrievably
lost, and, pressed by hunger, fierce, clamorous
hunger, often seek in vice that relief they despair to
obtain from commiseration."</p>

<p>At this moment the Goualeuse entered the parlour.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, my dear child?" inquired
Madame Georges, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Visiting the fruit-house, madame, after having shut
up the hen-houses and gates of the poultry-yard. All
the fruit has kept excellently,&mdash;all but those I ran away
with and ate."</p>

<p>"Now, Marie, why take all this fatigue upon yourself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
You should have left all this tiring work to Claudine; I
fear you have quite tired yourself."</p>

<p>"No, no! dear Madame Georges; I wouldn't let
Claudine help me for the world. I take so much delight
in my fruit-house,&mdash;the smell of the beautiful ripe fruit
is so delicious."</p>

<p>"M. le Curé," said Madame Georges, "you must go
some day and see Marie's fruit-house. You can scarcely
imagine the taste with which she has arranged it; each
different variety of fruit is separated by rows of grapes,
and the grapes are again divided off by strips of moss."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, M. le Curé; pray do come and see it," said
the Goualeuse, innocently; "I am sure you would be
pleased with it. You would be surprised what a pretty
contrast the moss makes to the bright rosy apples or the
rich golden pears. There are some such lovely waxen
apples, quite a pure red and white; and really, as they
lie surrounded by the soft green moss, I cannot help
thinking of the heads of little cherubim just peeping
out from the glorious clouds of heaven," added the
delighted Goualeuse, speaking with all the enthusiasm
of an artist of the work of her creation.</p>

<p>The curé looked at Madame Georges, then smilingly
replied to Fleur-de-Marie:</p>

<p>"I have already admired the dairy over which you
preside, my child, and can venture to declare it perfect
in its way; the most particular dairy-woman might envy
you the perfection to which you have brought it. Ere
long, I promise myself the pleasure of visiting your
fruit-house, and passing a similar compliment on your
skill in arrangement. You shall then introduce me to
those charming rosy apples and delicious golden pears,
as well as to the little cherubim pippins so prettily peeping
from their mossy beds. But see! the sun has
already set; you will scarcely have sufficient time to
conduct me back to the rectory-house and return before
dark. Come, my child, fetch your cloak, and let us be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
gone; or, now I think of it, do you remain at home
this cold bitter night, and let one of the farm servants
go home with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, M. le Curé," replied the kind Madame Georges,
"Marie will be quite wretched if she is not allowed to
accompany you; she so much enjoys the happiness of
escorting you home every evening."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Monsieur le Curé," added the Goualeuse,
timidly raising her large blue eyes to the priest's countenance,
"I shall fear you are displeased with me if you
do not permit me to accompany you as usual."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear child, wrap yourself up very
warm, and let us go."</p>

<p>Fleur-de-Marie hastily threw over her shoulders a sort
of cloak of coarse white cloth, edged with black velvet,
and with a large hood, to be drawn at pleasure over the
head. Thus equipped, she eagerly offered her arm to her
venerable friend.</p>

<p>"Happily," said he, in taking it, "the distance is but
trifling, and the road both good and safe to pass at all
hours."</p>

<p>"As it is somewhat later to-night than usual," said
Madame Georges, "will you have one of the farm-people
to return with you, Marie?"</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a coward?" said Marie, playfully.
"I am very much obliged to you for your good
opinion, madame. No, pray do not let any one be called
away on my account. It is not a quarter of an hour's
walk from here to the rectory. I shall be back long
before dark."</p>

<p>"Well, as you like. I merely thought it would be
company for you; for as to fearing, thank heaven, there
is no cause. Loose vagabond people, likely to interrupt
your progress, are wholly unknown here."</p>

<p>"And, were I not equally sure of the absence of all
danger, I would not accept this dear child's arm," added
the curé, "useful as, I confess, I find it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>And, leaning on Fleur-de-Marie, who regulated her
light step to suit the slow and laboured pace of the old
man, the two friends quitted the farm.</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk brought the Goualeuse and the
priest close to the hollow road in which the Schoolmaster,
the Chouette, and Tortillard, were lying in
ambush.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h5>THE AMBUSCADE.</h5>


<p>The church and parsonage of Bouqueval were placed
on the side of a hill covered with chestnut-trees, and
commanded an entire view of the village. Fleur-de-Marie
and the abbé reached a winding path which led to
the clergyman's home, crossing the sunken road by which
the hill was intersected diagonally. The Chouette, the
Schoolmaster, and Tortillard, concealed in one of the
hollows of the road, saw the priest and Fleur-de-Marie
descend into the ravine, and leave it again by a steep declivity.
The features of the young girl being hidden
under the hood of her cloak, the Chouette did not recognise
her old victim.</p>

<p>"Silence, my old boy," said the old harridan to the
Schoolmaster; "the young 'mot' and the 'black slug' are
just crossing the path. I know her by the description
which the tall man in black gave us; a country appearance,
neither tall nor short; a petticoat shot with brown,
and a woollen mantle with a black border. She walks
every day with a 'devil-dodger' to his 'crib,' and returns
alone. When she come back, which she will do presently
by the end of the road, we must spring upon her
and carry her off to the coach."</p>

<p>"If she cries for help," replied the Schoolmaster,
"they will hear her at the farm, if, as you say, the out-buildings
are visible from here; for you&mdash;you can see,"
he added, in a sullen tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we can see the buildings from here quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
plainly," said Tortillard. "It is only a minute ago that
I climbed to the top of the bank, and, lying down on my
belly, I could hear a carter who was talking to his horses
in the yard there."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, then, what we must do," said the Schoolmaster,
after a moment's silence. "Let Tortillard have
the watch at the entrance to the path. When he sees
the young girl returning, let him go and meet her, saying
that he is the son of a poor old woman who has hurt
herself by falling down the hollow road, and beg the
girl to come to her assistance."</p>

<p>"I'm up to you, <i>fourline</i>; the poor old woman is your
darling Chouette. You're 'wide-awake!' My man, you
are always the king of the 'downy ones' (<i>têtards</i>). What
must I do afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Conceal yourself in the hollow way on the side where
Barbillon is waiting with the coach. I will be at hand.
When Tortillard has brought the wench to you in the
middle of the ravine, leave off whimpering and spring
upon her, put one 'mauley' round her 'squeeze,' and the
other into her 'patter-box,' and 'grab' her 'red rag' to
prevent her from squeaking."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, <i>fourline</i>; as we did with the woman
at the canal of St. Martin, when we gave her cold water
for supper (drowned her), after having 'prigged' her 'negress'
(the parcel wrapped in black oil-skin) which she
had under her arm,&mdash;the same 'dodge,' isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, precisely. But mind, grab the girl tight whilst
Tortillard comes and fetches me. We three will then
bundle her up in my cloak, carry her to Barbillon's
coach, from thence to the plain of St. Denis, where the
man in black will await us."</p>

<p>"That's the way to do business, my <i>fourline</i>; you are
without an equal! If I could, I would let off a firework
on your head, and illuminate you with the colours of
Saint Charlot, the patron of 'scragsmen.' Do you see,
you urchin? If you would be an 'out-and-outer,' make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
my husband your model," said the Chouette, boastingly to
Tortillard. Then, addressing the Schoolmaster, "By
the way, do you know that Barbillon is in an awful 'funk'
(fright)? He thinks that he shall be had up before the
'beaks' on a swinging matter."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The other day, returning from Mother Martial's, the
widow of the man who was scragged, and who keeps the
boozing-ken in the Ile du Ravageur, Barbillon, the Gros-Boiteux,
and the Skeleton had a row with the husband of
the milkwoman who comes every morning from the
country in a little cart drawn by a donkey, to sell her
milk in the Cité, at the corner of the Rue de la Vieille-Draperie,
close to the ogress's of the 'White Rabbit,'
and they 'walked into him with their slashers' (killed him
with their knives)."</p>

<p>The son of Bras Rouge, who did not understand slang,
listened to the Chouette with a sort of disappointed
curiosity.</p>

<p>"You would like to know, little man, what we are
saying, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You were talking of Mother Martial, who is
at the Ile du Ravageur, near Asnières. I know her very
well, and her daughter Calebasse and François and Amandine,
who are about as old as I am, and who are made to
bear everybody's snubs and thumps in the house. But
when you talked of 'walking into (<i>buter</i>) any one,'
that's slang, I know."</p>

<p>"It is; and, if you're a very good chap, I'll teach you
to 'patter flash.' You're just the age when it may be
very useful to you. Would you like to learn, my precious
lambkin?"</p>

<p>"I rather think I should, too, and no mistake; and
I would rather live with you than with my old cheat of
a mountebank, pounding his drugs. If I knew where he
hides his 'rat-poison for men,' I'd put some in his soup,
and then that would settle the quarrel between us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chouette laughed heartily, and said to Tortillard,
drawing him towards her:</p>

<p>"Come, chick, and kiss his mammy. What a droll
boy it is&mdash;a darling! But, my manikin, how didst
know that he had 'rat-poison for men'?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'cause I heard him say so one day when I was
hid in the cupboard in the room where he keeps his bottles,
his brass machines, and where he mixes his stuffs
together."</p>

<p>"What did you hear him say?" asked the Chouette.</p>

<p>"I heard him say to a gentleman that he gave a powder
to, in a paper, 'When you are tired of life, take this
in three doses, and you will sleep without sickness or
sorrow.'"</p>

<p>"Who was the gentleman?" asked the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Oh, a very handsome gentleman with black moustachios,
and a face as pretty as a girl's. He came
another time; and then, when he left, I followed him,
by M. Bradamanti's order, to find out where he perched.
The fine gentleman went into the Rue de Chaillot, and
entered a very grand house. My master said to me,
'No matter where this gentleman goes, follow and wait
for him at the door. If he comes out again, still keep
your eye on him, until he does not come out of the place
where he enters, and that will prove that he lives there.
Then Tortillard, my boy, twist (<i>tortille</i>) yourself about
to find out his name, or I will twist your ears in a way
that will astonish you.'"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did twist myself about, and found out his
name."</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?" inquired the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Why, so. I'm not a fool; so I went to the porter
at the house in the Rue de Chaillot, where this gentleman
had gone in and not come out again. The porter
had his hair finely powdered, with a fine brown coat with
a yellow collar trimmed with silver. So I says to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
'Good gentleman, I have come to ask for a hundred
sous which the gentleman of the house has promised me
for having found his dog and brought it back to him&mdash;a
little black dog called Trumpet; and the gentleman
with dark features, with black moustachios, a white
riding-coat, and light blue pantaloons, told me he lived
at No. 11 Rue de Chaillot, and that his name was
Dupont.' 'The gentleman you're talking of is my master,
and his name is the Viscount de St. Remy, and we
have no dog here but yourself, you young scamp; so "cut
your stick," or I'll make you remember coming here, and
trying to do me out of a hundred sous,' says the porter
to me; and he gave me a kick as he said it. But I
didn't mind that," added Tortillard most philosophically,
"for I found out the name of the handsome young gentleman
with black moustachios, who came to my master's
to buy the 'rat-poison for men' who are tired of
living. He is called the Viscount de St. Remy,&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;St.
Remy," added the son of Bras Rouge,
humming the last words, as was his usual habit.</p>

<p>"Clever little darling&mdash;I could eat him up alive!"
said the Chouette, embracing Tortillard. "Never was
such a knowing fellow. He deserves that I should be
his mother, the dear rascal does."</p>

<p>And the hag embraced Tortillard with an absurd
affectation. The son of Bras Rouge, touched by this
proof of affection, and desirous of showing his gratitude,
eagerly answered:</p>

<p>"Only you tell me what to do, and you shall see how
I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Will you, though? Well, then, you sha'n't repent
doing so."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like always to stay with you!"</p>

<p>"If you behave well, we may see about that. You
sha'n't leave us if you are a good boy."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Schoolmaster, "you shall lead me
about like a poor blind man, and say you are my son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
We will get into houses in this way, and then&mdash;ten
thousand slaughters!" added the assassin with enthusiasm;
"the Chouette will assist us in making lucky
hits. I will then teach that devil of a Rodolph, who
blinded me, that I am not yet quite done for. He took
away my eyesight, but he could not, did not remove my
bent for mischief. I would be the head, Tortillard the
eyes, and you the hand,&mdash;eh, Chouette? You will help
me in this, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Am I not with you to gallows and rope, <i>fourline?</i>
Didn't I, when I left the hospital, and learnt that you
had sent the 'yokel' from St. Mandé to ask for me at the
ogress's&mdash;didn't I run to you at the village directly,
telling those chawbacons of labourers that I was your
<i>rib?</i>"</p>

<p>These words of the "one-eyed's" reminded the
Schoolmaster of an unpleasant affair, and, altering
his tone and language with the Chouette, he said, in
a surly tone:</p>

<p>"Yes, I was getting tired of being all by myself with
these honest people. After a month I could not stand it
any longer; I was frightened. So then I thought of
trying to find you out; and a nice thing I did for myself,"
he added, in a tone of increasing anger; "for the
day after you arrived I was robbed of the rest of the
money which that devil in the Allée des Veuves had
given me. Yes, some one stole my belt full of gold
whilst I was asleep. It was only you who could have
done it; and so now I am at your mercy. Whenever I
think of it, I can hardly restrain myself from killing you
on the spot&mdash;you cursed old robber, you!" and he
stepped towards the old woman.</p>

<p>"Look out for yourself, if you try to do any harm to
the Chouette!" cried Tortillard.</p>

<p>"I will smash you both&mdash;you and she&mdash;base vipers
as you are!" cried the ruffian, enraged; and, hearing
the boy mumbling near him, he aimed at him so violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a blow with his fist, as must have killed him if it had
struck him. Tortillard, as much to revenge himself as
the Chouette, picked up a stone, took aim, and struck
the Schoolmaster on the forehead. The blow was not
dangerous, but very painful. The brigand grew furious
with passion, raging like a wounded bull, and, rushing
forward swiftly and at random, stumbled.</p>

<p>"What, break your own back?" shouted the Chouette,
laughing till she cried.</p>

<p>Despite the bloody ties which bound her to this monster,
she saw how entirely, and with a sort of savage
delight, this man, formerly so dreaded, and so proud of
his giant strength, was reduced to impotence. The old
wretch, by these feelings, justified that cold-blooded idea
of La Rochefoucauld's, that "there is something in the
misfortunes of our best friends which does not displease
us." The disgusting brat, with his tawny cheeks and
weasel face, enjoyed and participated in the mirth of
the one-eyed hag. The Schoolmaster tripped again,
and the urchin exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Open your peepers, old fellow; look about you.
You are going the wrong way. What capers you are
cutting! Can't you see your way? Why don't you
wipe your eye-glasses?"</p>

<p>Unable to seize on the boy, the athletic murderer
stopped, struck his foot violently on the ground, put his
enormous and hairy fists to his eyes, and then uttered a
sound which resembled the hoarse scream of a muzzled
tiger.</p>

<p>"Got a bad cough, I'm afraid, old chap!" said Bras
Rouge's brat. "You're hoarse, I'm afraid? I have
some capital liquorice which a <i>gen-d'arme</i> gave me.
P'raps you'd like to try it?" and, taking up a handful
of sand, he threw it in the face of the ruffian.</p>

<p>Struck full in his countenance by this shower of
gravel, the Schoolmaster suffered still more severely by
this last attack than by the blow from the stone. Become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
pale, in spite of his livid and cicatrised features,
he extended his two arms suddenly in the form of a
cross, in a moment of inexpressible agony and despair,
and, raising his frightful face to heaven, he cried, in a
voice of deep suffering:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>This involuntary appeal to divine mercy by a man
stained by every crime, a bandit in whose presence but
very recently the most resolute of his fellows trembled,
appeared like an interposition of Providence.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" said the Chouette, in a mocking
tone; "look at the thief making the crucifix! You
mistake your road, my man. It is the 'old one' you
should call to your help."</p>

<p>"A knife! Oh, for a knife to kill myself! A knife!
since all the world abandons me!" shrieked the wretch,
gnawing his fists for very agony and rage.</p>

<p>"A knife!&mdash;there's one in your pocket, cut-throat,
and with an edge, too. The little old man in the Rue
du Roule, you know, one moonlight night, and the cattle-dealer
in the Poissy road, could tell the 'moles' all about
it. But if you want it, it's here."</p>

<p>The Schoolmaster, when thus instructed, changed the
conversation, and replied, in a surly and threatening
tone:</p>

<p>"The Chourineur was true; he did not rob, but had
pity on me."</p>

<p>"Why did you say that I had 'prigged your blunt'?"
inquired the Chouette, hardly able to restrain her
laughter.</p>

<p>"It was only you who came into my room," said the
miscreant. "I was robbed on the night of your arrival,
and who else could I suspect? Those country people
could not have done such a thing."</p>

<p>"Why should not country people steal as well as
other folks? Is it because they drink milk and gather
grass for their rabbits?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. I only know I'm robbed."</p>

<p>"And is that the fault of your own Chouette? What!
suspect me? Do you think if I had got your belt that I
should stay any longer with you. What a fool you are!
Why, if I had chosen to 'pouch your blunt,' I could, of
course; but, as true as I'm Chouette, you would have
seen me again when the 'pewter' was spent, for I like
you as well now with your eyes white, as I did&mdash;you
rogue, you! Come, be decent, and leave off grinding
your 'snags' in that way, or you'll break 'em."</p>

<p>"It's just as if he was a-cracking nuts," said Tortillard.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! what a droll baby it is! But
quiet, now, quiet, my man of men; let him laugh,
it is but an infant. You must own you have been
unfair; for when the tall man in mourning, who
looks like a mute at a funeral, said to me, 'A
thousand francs are yours if you carry off this young
girl from the farm at Bouqueval, and bring her to the
spot in the Plain of St. Denis that I shall tell you,'
say, cut-throat, didn't I directly tell you of the affair
and agree to share with you, instead of choosing some
'pal' with his eyesight clear? Why, it's like making you
a handsome present for doing nothing; for unless to
bundle up the girl and carry her, with Tortillard's
assistance, you would be of no more use to me than
the fifth wheel to an omnibus. But never mind; for,
although I could have robbed you if I would, I like,
on the contrary, to do you service. I should wish you
to owe everything to your darling Chouette&mdash;that's my
way, that is. We must give two hundred 'bob' to Barbillon
for driving the coach, and coming once before
with the servant of the tall man in mourning, to look
about the place and determine where we should hide
ourselves whilst we waited for the young miss; and
then we shall have eight hundred 'bob' between us.
What do you say to that old boy? What! still angry
with your old woman?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do I know that you will give me a 'mag'
when once the thing's done? Why!&mdash;I"&mdash;said the
ruffian, in a tone of gloomy distrust.</p>

<p>"Why, if I like, I need not give you a dump, that's
true enough; for you are on my gridiron, my lad, as
I once had the Goualeuse; and so I will broil you to
my own taste, till the 'old one' gets the cooking of my
darling&mdash;ha! ha! ha! What, still sulky with your
Chouette?" added the horrible woman, patting the
shoulder of the ruffian, who stood mute and motionless.</p>

<p>"You are right," said he, with a sigh of concentrated
rage; "it is my fate&mdash;mine&mdash;mine! At the mercy
of a woman and child whom but lately I could have
killed with a blow. Oh, if I were not afraid of dying!"
said he, falling back against the bank.</p>

<p>"What! a coward!&mdash;you&mdash;you a coward!" said
the Chouette, contemptuously. "Why, you'll be talking
next of your conscience! What a precious farce!
Well, if you haven't more pluck than that, I'll 'cut' and
leave you."</p>

<p>"And that I cannot have my revenge of the man who
in thus making a martyr of me has reduced me to
the wretched situation in which I am!" screamed the
Schoolmaster, in a renewal of fury. "I am afraid
of death&mdash;yes, I own it, I am afraid. But if I were
told, 'This man Rodolph is between your arms&mdash;your
two arms&mdash;and now you shall both be flung into a pit,'
I would say, 'Throw us, then, at once.' Yes, for then I
should be safe not to relax my clutch, till we both
reached the bottom together. I would fix my teeth
in his face&mdash;his throat&mdash;his heart. I would tear
him to pieces with my teeth&mdash;yes, my teeth; for I
should be jealous of a knife!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, <i>fourline!</i> now you are my own dear love
again. Calm yourself. We will find him again, that
wretch of a Rodolph, and the Chourineur too. Come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
pluck up, old man; we will yet work our will on them
both. I say it, on both!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, you will not forsake me?" cried the
brigand to the Chouette in a subdued tone, mingled,
however, with distrust. "If you do leave me, what
will become of me?"</p>

<p>"That's true. I say, <i>fourline</i>, what a joke if Tortillard
and I were to 'mizzle' with the 'drag,' and leave you
where you are&mdash;in the middle of the fields; and the
night air begins to nip very sharp. I say, it would be
a joke, old cutpurse, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>At this threat the Schoolmaster shuddered, and,
coming towards the Chouette, said tremulously, "No,
no, you wouldn't do that, Chouette; nor you, Tortillard.
It would be too bad, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! 'Too bad,' says he, the gentle dear!
And the little old man in the Rue du Roule; and the
cattle-dealer and the woman in Saint Martin's Canal;
and the gentleman in the Allée des Veuves; they found
you nice and amiable, I don't think&mdash;didn't they&mdash;with
your 'larding-pin?' Why, then, in your turn, shouldn't
you be left to such tender mercy as you have showed?"</p>

<p>"I'm in your power, don't abuse it," said the Schoolmaster.
"Come, come, I confess I was wrong to suspect
you. I was wrong to try and thump Tortillard; and,
you see, I beg pardon; and of you too, Tortillard. Yes,
I ask pardon of both."</p>

<p>"I will have you ask pardon on your knees for having
tried to beat the Chouette," said Tortillard.</p>

<p>"You rum little beggar, how funny you are!" said
the Chouette, laughing loudly; "but I should like to
see what a 'guy' you will make of yourself. So on
your knees, as if you were 'pattering' love to your old
darling. Come, do it directly, or we will leave you;
and I tell you that in half an hour it will be quite dark,
though you don't look as if you thought so, old
'No-Eyes.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Night or day, what's that to him?" said Tortillard,
saucily. "The gentleman always has his shutters
closed."</p>

<p>"Then here, on my knees, I humbly ask your pardon,
Chouette; and yours also, Tortillard! Will not that
content you?" said the robber, kneeling in the middle
of the highway. "And now will you leave me?"</p>

<p>This strange group, enclosed by the embankment of
the ravine, and lighted by the red glimmer of the twilight,
was hideous to behold. In the middle of the road
the Schoolmaster, on his knees, extended his large and
coarse hands towards the one-eyed hag; his thick and
matted hair, which his fright had dishevelled, left exposed
his motionless, rigid, glassy, dead eyeballs&mdash;the
very glance of a corpse. Stooping deprecatingly his
broad-spread shoulders, this Hercules kneels abjectly,
and trembles at the feet of an old woman and a child!</p>

<p>The old hag herself, wrapped in a red-checked shawl,
her head covered with an old cap of black lace, which
allowed some locks of her grizzled hair to escape, looked
down with an air of haughty contempt and domineering
pride on the Schoolmaster. The bony, scorched,
shrivelled, and livid countenance of the parrot-nosed old
harridan expressed a savage and insulting joy; her small
but fierce eye glistened like a burning coal; a sinister
expression curled her lips, shaded with long straight
hairs, and revealed three or four large, yellow, and
decayed fangs.</p>

<p>Tortillard, clothed in a blouse with a leathern belt,
standing on one leg, leaned on the Chouette's arm to
keep himself upright. The bad expression and cunning
look of this deformed imp, with a complexion as sallow
as his hair, betokened at this moment his disposition&mdash;half
fiend, half monkey. The shadow cast from the
declivity of the ravine increased the horrid <i>tout ensemble</i>
of the scene, which the increasing darkness half hid.</p>

<p>"Promise me,&mdash;oh, promise me&mdash;at least, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
forsake me!" repeated the Schoolmaster, frightened by
the silence of the Chouette and Tortillard, who were
enjoying his dismay. "Are you not here?" added the
murderer, leaning forward to listen, and advancing his
arms mechanically.</p>

<p>"Yes, my man, we are here; don't be frightened.
Forsake you! leave my love! the man of my heart!
No, I'd sooner be 'scragged'! Once for all, I will tell
you why I will not forsake you. Listen, and profit. I
have always liked to have some one in my grip&mdash;beast
or Christian. Before I had Pegriotte (oh! that the
'old one' would return her to my clutch! for I have
still my idea of scaling off her beauty with my bottle of
vitriol)&mdash;before Pegriotte's turn, I had a brat who
froze to death under my care. For that little job, I got
six years in the 'Stone Jug.' Then I used to have little
birds, which I used to tame, and then pluck 'em alive.
Ha! ha! but that was troublesome work, for they did
not last long. When I left the 'Jug,' the Goualeuse came
to hand; but the little brat ran away before I had had
half my fun out of her carcass. Well, then I had a dog,
who had his little troubles as well as she had; and I cut
off one of his hind feet and one of his four feet; and you
never saw such a rum beggar as I made of him; I
almost burst my sides with laughing at him!"</p>

<p>"I must serve a dog I know of, who bit me one
day, in the same way," said the promising Master
Tortillard.</p>

<p>"When I fell in again with you, my darling," continued
the Chouette, "I was trying what I could do that
was miserable with a cat. Well, now, at this moment,
you, old boy, shall be my cat, my dog, my bird, my
Pegriotte; you shall be anything to worry (<i>bête de souffrance</i>).
Do you understand, my love? Instead of
having a bird or a child to make miserable, I shall have,
as it were, a wolf or a tiger. I think that's rather a
bright idea; isn't it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hag! devil!" cried the Schoolmaster, rising in a
desperate rage.</p>

<p>"What, my pet angry with his darling old deary?
Well, if it must be so, it must. Have your own way;
you have a right to it. Good night, blind sheep!"</p>

<p>"The field-gate is wide open, so walk alone, Mister
No-eyes; and, if you toddle straight, you'll reach the
right road somehow," said Tortillard, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I could die! die! die!" said the Schoolmaster,
writhing and twisting his arms about in agony.</p>

<p>At this moment, Tortillard, stooping to the ground,
exclaimed, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I hear footsteps in the path; let us hide; it is not
the young miss, for they come the same way as she did."</p>

<p>On the instant, a stout peasant girl in the prime of
youth, followed by a large shepherd's dog, carrying on
her head an open basket, appeared, and followed the
same path which the priest and the Goualeuse had taken.
We will rejoin the two latter, leaving the three accomplices
concealed in the hollow of the path.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h5>THE RECTORY-HOUSE.</h5>


<p>The last rays of the sun were gradually disappearing
behind the vast pile of the Château d'Ecouen
and the woods which surrounded it. On all sides, until the
sight lost them in the distance, were vast tracts of land
lying in brown furrows hardened by the frost&mdash;an
extensive desert, of which the hamlet of Bouqueval
appeared to be the oasis. The sky, which was serenely
glorious, was tinted by the sunset, and glowed with long
lines of empurpled light, the certain token of wind and
cold. These tints, which were at first of a deep red,
became violet; then a bluish black, as the twilight grew
more and more dark on the atmosphere. The crescent
of the moon was as delicately and clearly defined as a
silver ring, and began to shine beautifully in the midst
of the blue and dimmed sky, where many stars already
had appeared. The silence was profound; the hour
most solemn. The curate stopped for a moment on the
summit of the acclivity to enjoy the calm of this delicious
evening. After some minutes' reflection, he extended his
trembling hand towards the depths of the horizon, half
veiled by the shadows of the evening, and said to Fleur-de-Marie,
who was walking pensively beside him:</p>

<p>"Look, my child, at the vastness and extent to which
we have no visible limit; we hear not the slightest
sound. Say, does not this silence give us an idea of
infinity and of eternity? I say this to you, Marie,
because you are peculiarly sensitive of the beauties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
creation. I have often been struck at the admiration,
alike poetical and religious, with which they inspire you,&mdash;you,
a poor prisoner so long deprived of them. Are
you not, as I am, struck with the solemn tranquillity of
the hour?"</p>

<p>The Goualeuse made no reply. The curé, regarding
her with astonishment, found she was weeping.</p>

<p>"What ails you, my child?"</p>

<p>"My father, I am unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Unhappy!&mdash;you?&mdash;still unhappy!"</p>

<p>"I know it is ingratitude to complain of my lot after
all that has been and is done for me; and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet?"</p>

<p>"Father, I pray of you forgive my sorrows; their
expression may offend my benefactors."</p>

<p>"Listen, Marie. We have often asked you the cause
of these sorrows with which you are depressed, and
which excite in your second mother the most serious
uneasiness. You have avoided all reply, and we have
respected your secret whilst we have been afflicted at
not being able to solace your sorrows."</p>

<p>"Alas; good father, I dare not tell you what is passing
in my mind. I have been moved, as you have been,
at the sight of this calm and saddening evening. My
heart is sorely afflicted, and I have wept."</p>

<p>"But what ails you, Marie? You know how we love
you! Come, tell me all. You should; for I must tell
you that the time is very close at hand when Madame
Georges and M. Rodolph will present you at the baptismal
font, and take upon themselves the engagement
before God to protect you all the days of your life."</p>

<p>"M. Rodolph&mdash;he who has saved me?" cried Fleur-de-Marie,
clasping her hands; "he will deign to give
me this new proof of affection! Oh, indeed, my father,
I can no longer conceal from you anything, lest I
should, indeed, deserve to be called and thought an
ingrate."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"An ingrate! How?"</p>

<p>"That you may understand me, I must begin and tell
you of my first day at the farm."</p>

<p>"Then let us talk as we walk on."</p>

<p>"You will be indulgent to me, my father? What I
shall say may perhaps be wrong."</p>

<p>"The Lord has shown his mercy unto you. Be of
good heart."</p>

<p>"When," said Fleur-de-Marie, after a moment's reflection,
"I knew that, on arriving here, I should not again
leave the farm and Madame Georges, I believed it was
all a dream. At first I felt giddy with my happiness, and
thought every moment of M. Rodolph. Very often
when I was alone, and in spite of myself, I raised my
eyes to heaven, as if to seek him there and thank him.
Afterwards&mdash;and I was wrong, father&mdash;I thought more
of him than God, attributing to him what God alone
could do. I was happy&mdash;as happy as a creature who
had suddenly and entirely escaped from a great danger.
You and Madame Georges were so kind to me, that I
thought I deserved pity rather than blame."</p>

<p>The curé looked at the Goualeuse with an air of
surprise. She continued:</p>

<p>"Gradually I became used to my sweet course of life.
I no longer felt fear when I awoke, of finding myself at
the ogress's. I seemed to sleep in full security, and all
my delight was to assist Madame Georges in her work,
and to apply myself to the lesson you gave me, my
father, as well as to profit by your advice and exhortation.
Except some moments of shame, when I reflected
on the past, I thought myself equal to all the world, because
all the world was so kind to me. When, one
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here sobs cut short poor Fleur-de-Marie's narration.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my poor child, calm yourself. Courage,
courage!"</p>

<p>The Goualeuse wiped her eyes, and resumed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"You recollect, father, during the fêtes of the Toussaints,
that Madame Dubreuil, who superintends the
Duke de Lucenay's farm at Arnouville, came, with her
daughter, to pass some time with us?"</p>

<p>"I do; and I was delighted to see you form an
acquaintance with Clara Dubreuil, who is a very excellent
girl."</p>

<p>"She is an angel&mdash;an angel, father. When I knew
that she was coming to stay for some days at the farm,
my delight was so great that I could think of nothing
else but the moment when she should arrive. At length
she came. I was in my room, which she was to share
with me; and, whilst I was putting it into nice order I
was sent for. I went into the saloon, my heart beating
excessively, when Madame Georges, presenting me to
the pretty young lady, whose looks were so kind and
good, said, 'Marie, here is a friend for you.' 'I hope,'
added Madame Dubreuil, 'that you and my daughter
will soon be like two sisters;' and hardly had her
mother uttered these words, than Mademoiselle Clara
came and embraced me. Then, father," continued Fleur-de-Marie,
weeping, "I do not know what came over me;
but, when I felt the fresh and fair face of Clara pressed
against my cheek of shame, that cheek became scorching
with guilt&mdash;remorse. I remembered who and what I
was;&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;to receive the caresses of a good and
virtuous girl!"</p>

<p>"Why, my child?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my father," cried Fleur-de-Marie, interrupting
the curé with painful emotion, "when M. Rodolph took
me away from the Cité, I began vaguely to be conscious
of the depth of my degradation. But do you think that
education, advice, the examples I receive from Madame
Georges and yourself, have not, whilst they have enlightened
my mind, made me, alas! to comprehend but too
clearly that I have been more culpable than unfortunate?
Before Clara's arrival, when these thoughts grew upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
me, I drove them away by seeking to please Madame
Georges and you, father. If I blushed for the past it
was only in my own presence. But the sight of this
young lady of my own age, so charming, so virtuous, has
conjured up the recollection of the distance that exists
between us; and, for the first time, I have felt that
there are wrongs which nothing can efface. From that
time the thought has haunted me perpetually, and, in
spite of myself, I recur to it. From that day I have not
had one moment's repose." The Goualeuse again wiped
her eyes, that swam in tears.</p>

<p>After having looked at her for some moments with a
gaze of the tenderest pity, the curé replied:</p>

<p>"Reflect, my child, that if Madame Georges desired
to see you the friend of Mademoiselle Dubreuil, it was
that she felt you were worthy of such a confidence
from your good conduct. Your reproaches, addressed
to yourself, seem almost to impugn your second mother."</p>

<p>"I feel that, father, and was wrong, no doubt; but I
could not subdue my shame and fear. When Clara was
once settled at the farm, I was as sad as I had before
thought I should be happy, when I reflected on the
pleasure of having a companion of my own age. She, on
the contrary, was all joy and lightness. She had a bed
in my apartment; and the first evening before she went
to bed she kissed me, saying that she loved me already,
and felt every kind sentiment towards me. She made
me to call her Clara, and she would call me Marie. Then
she said her prayers, telling me that she would join my
name with hers in her prayers, if I would also unite her
name with mine. I did not dare to refuse; and, after
talking for some time, she went to sleep. I had not got
into my bed, and, approaching her bedside, I contemplated
her angel face with tears in my eyes; and then, reflecting
that she was sleeping in the same chamber with me&mdash;with
one who had been at the ogress's, mixed up with
robbers and murderers, I trembled as if I had committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
some crime, and a thousand nameless fears beset me. I
thought that God would one day punish me. I went to
sleep and had horrid dreams. I saw again those frightful
objects I had nearly forgotten&mdash;the Chourineur, the
Schoolmaster, the Chouette&mdash;that horrible, one-eyed
woman who had tortured my earliest infancy. Oh, what
a night! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>&mdash;what a night! What dreams!"
said the Goualeuse, shuddering at their very recollection.</p>

<p>"Poor Marie!" said the curé with emotion. "Why
did you not earlier tell me all this? I should have found
comfort for you. But go on."</p>

<p>"I slept so late, that Mademoiselle Clara awoke me by
kissing me. To overcome what she called my coldness,
and show her regard, she told me a secret&mdash;that she
was going to be married when she was eighteen to the
son of a farmer at Goussainville, whom she loved very
dearly, and the union had long been agreed upon by the
two families. Then she added a few words of her past
life, so simple, calm, and happy! She had never quitted
her mother, and never intended to do so, for her husband
was to take part in the management of the farm with M.
Dubreuil. 'Now, Marie,' she said, 'you know me as well
as if you were my sister. So tell me all about your early
days.'</p>

<p>"I thought when I heard the words that I should
have died of them; I blushed and stammered; I did
not know what Madame Georges had said of me, and I
was fearful of telling a falsehood; I answered vaguely,
that I had been an orphan, educated by a very rigid
person; and that I had not been happy in my infancy;
and that my happiness was dated from the moment
when I had come to live with Madame Georges; then
Clara, as much by interest as curiosity, asked me where
I had been educated, in the city or the country, my
father's name, and, above all, if I remembered anything
of my mother. All these questions embarrassed as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as they pained me, for I was obliged to reply with falsehood,
and you have taught me, father, how wicked it is
to lie; but Clara did not think that I was deceiving her;
she attributed the hesitation of my answers to the pain
which my early sorrows renewed; she believed me and
pitied me with a sincerity that cut me to the soul. Oh,
father, you never can know what I suffered in this conversation,
and how much it cost me only to reply in
language of falsehood and hypocrisy!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunate girl! The anger of heaven will weigh
heavily on those who, by casting you into the vile road
of perdition, have compelled you to undergo all your life
the sad consequences of a first fault."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they were indeed cruel, father," replied
Fleur-de-Marie, bitterly, "for my shame is ineffaceable.
As Clara talked to me of the happiness that awaited her,&mdash;her
marriage, her peaceful joys of home, I could not
help comparing my lot with hers; for, in spite of the
kindness showered upon me, my fate must always be
miserable. You and Madame Georges, in teaching me
what virtue is, have taught me the depth of that abasement
into which I had fallen; nothing can take from me
the brand of having been the refuse of all that is vilest
in the world. Alas! if the knowledge of good and evil
was to be so sad to me, why not have abandoned me to
my unhappy fate?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie, Marie!"</p>

<p>"Father, I speak ill, do I not? Alas! I dare not
confess it; but I am at times so ungrateful as to repine
at the benefits heaped upon me, and to say to myself,
'If I had not been snatched from infamy, why, wretchedness,
misery, blows, would soon have ended my life; and,
at least, I should have remained in ignorance of that
purity which I must for ever regret.'"</p>

<p>"Alas! Marie, that is indeed fatal! A nature ever
so nobly endowed by the Creator, though plunged but
for one day in the foul mire from which you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
been extricated, will preserve for ever the ineffaceable
stigma."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my father," cried Fleur-de-Marie, full of
grief, "I must despair until I die!"</p>

<p>"You must despair of ever tearing out this frightful
page from the book of your existence," said the priest,
in a sad and serious voice; "but you must have faith in
the infinite mercy of the Almighty. Here, on earth, my
poor child, there are for you tears, remorse, expiation;
but, one day, there,&mdash;up there," and he raised his hand
to the sky, now filling with stars, "there is pardon and
everlasting happiness."</p>

<p>"Pity, pity, <i>mon Dieu!</i> I am so young, and my life
may still endure so long," said the Goualeuse, in a voice
rent by agony, and falling at the curé's knees almost
involuntarily.</p>

<p>The priest was standing at the top of the hill, not far
from where his "modest mansion rose;" his black cassock,
his venerable countenance, shaded by long white
locks, lighted by the last ray of twilight, stood out from
the horizon, which was of a deep transparency,&mdash;a perfect
clearness: pale gold in the west, sapphire over his
head. The priest again elevated towards heaven one of
his tremulous hands, and gave the other to Fleur-de-Marie,
who bedewed it with her tears. The hood of
her gray cloak fell at this moment from her shoulders,
displaying the perfect outline of her lovely profile,&mdash;her
charming features full of suffering, and suffused
with tears.</p>

<p>This simple and sublime scene offered a strange contrast,&mdash;a
singular coincidence with the horrid one which,
almost at the same moment, was passing in the ravine
between the Schoolmaster and the Chouette. Concealed
in the darkness of the sombre cleft, assailed by base
fears, a fearful murderer, carrying on his person the
punishment of his crimes, was also on his knees, but
in the presence of an accessory, a sneering, revengeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Fury, who tormented him mercilessly, and urged him on
to fresh crimes,&mdash;that accomplice, the first cause of
Fleur-de-Marie's misery.</p>

<p>Of Fleur-de-Marie, whose days and nights were embittered
by never-dying remorse; whose anguish, hardly
endurable, was not conceivable; surrounded from her
earliest days by degraded, cruel, infamous outcasts of
society; leaving the walls of a prison for the den of the
ogress,&mdash;even a more horrid prison; never leaving the
precincts of her gaol, or the squalid streets of the Cité;
this unhappy young creature had hitherto lived in utter
ignorance of the beautiful and the good, as strange to
noble and religious sentiments as to the magnificent
splendour of nature. Then all that was admirable in
the creature and in the Creator was revealed in a moment
to her astonished soul. At this striking spectacle her
mind expanded, her intelligence unfolded itself, her noble
instincts were awakened; and because her mind expanded,
because her intelligence was unfolded, because
her noble instincts were awakened, yet the very consciousness
of her early degradation brings with it the
feeling of horror for her past life, alike torturing and
enduring,&mdash;she feels, as she had described, that, alas!
there are stains which nothing can remove.</p>

<p>"Ah, unhappiness for me!" said the Goualeuse, in
despair; "my whole life has long to run, it may be;
were it as long, as pure as your own, father, it must
henceforth be blighted by the knowledge and consciousness
of the past; unhappiness for me for ever!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Marie, it is happiness for you,&mdash;yes,
happiness for you. Your remorse, so full of bitterness,
but so purifying, testifies the religious susceptibility
of your mind. How many there are who, less nobly
sensitive than you, would, in your place, have soon forgotten
the fact, and only revelled in the delight of the
present. Believe me, every pang that you now endure
will tell in your favour when on high. God has left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
you for a moment in an unrighteous path, to reserve for
you the glory of repentance and the everlasting reward
reserved for expiation. Has he not said himself, 'Those
who fight the good fight and come to me with a smile
on their lips, they are my chosen; but they who, wounded
in the struggle, come to me fainting and dying, they are
the chosen amongst my chosen!' Courage, then, my
child! Support, help, counsel,&mdash;nothing will fail you.
I am very aged, but Madame Georges and M. Rodolph
have still many years before them; particularly M.
Rodolph, who has taken so deep an interest in you,
who watches your progress with so much anxiety."</p>

<p>The Goualeuse was about to reply, when she was
interrupted by the peasant girl whom we have already
mentioned, who, having followed in the steps of the curé
and Marie, now came up to them. She was one of the
peasants of the farm.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, M. le Curé," she said to the priest,
"but Madame Georges told me to bring this basket of
fruit to the rectory, and then I could accompany Mlle.
Marie back again, for it is getting late. So I have
brought Turk with me," added the dairy-maid, patting
an enormous dog of the Pyrenees, which would have
mastered a bear in a struggle. "Although we never
have any bad people about us here in the country, it is
as well to be careful."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Claudine. Here we are now
at the rectory. Pray thank Madame Georges for
me."</p>

<p>Then addressing the Goualeuse in a low tone, the curé
said to her, in a grave voice:</p>

<p>"I must go to-morrow to the conference of the diocese,
but I shall return at five o'clock. If you like, my child,
I will wait for you at the rectory. I see your state of
mind, and that you require a lengthened conversation
with me."</p>

<p>"I thank you, father," replied Fleur-de-Marie. "To-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
I will come, since you are so good as to allow
me to do so."</p>

<p>"Here we are at the garden gate," said the priest.
"Leave your basket there, Claudine; my housekeeper
will take it. Return quickly to the farm with Marie,
for it is almost night, and the cold is increasing.
To-morrow, Marie, at five o'clock."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, father."</p>

<p>The abbé went into his garden. The Goualeuse and
Claudine, followed by Turk, took the road to the farm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h5>THE RENCOUNTER.</h5>


<p>The night set in clear and cold. Following the advice
of the Schoolmaster, the Chouette had gone to that part
of the hollow way which was the most remote from the
path, and nearest to the cross-road where Barbillon was
waiting with the hackney-coach. Tortillard, who was
posted as an advanced guard, watched for the return of
Fleur-de-Marie, whom he was desirous of drawing into
the trap by begging her to come to the assistance of a
poor old woman. The son of Bras Rouge had advanced
a few steps out of the ravine to try and discern Marie,
when he heard the Goualeuse some way off speaking to
the peasant girl who accompanied her. The plan had
failed; and Tortillard quickly went down into the ravine
to run and inform the Chouette.</p>

<p>"There is somebody with the young girl," said he, in
a low and breathless tone.</p>

<p>"May the hangman squeeze her weasand, the little
beggar," exclaimed the Chouette in a rage.</p>

<p>"Who's with her?" asked the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt, the country wench who passed along
the road just now, followed by a large dog. I heard a
woman's voice," said Tortillard. "Hark!&mdash;do you
hear? There's the noise of their sabots," and, in the
silence of the night, the wooden soles sounded clearly on
the ground hardened by the frost.</p>

<p>"There are two of 'em. I can manage the young 'un
in the gray mantle, but what can we do with t'other?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>Fourline</i> can't see, and Tortillard is too weak to do for
the companion&mdash;devil choke her! What can be done?"
asked the Chouette.</p>

<p>"I'm not strong, but, if you like, I'll cling to the
legs of the country-woman with the dog. I'll hold on
by hands and teeth, and not let her go, I can tell you.
You can take away the little one in the meantime, you
know, Chouette."</p>

<p>"If they cry or resist, they will hear them at the
farm," replied the Chouette, "and come to their assistance
before we can reach Barbillon's coach. It is no
easy thing to carry off a woman who resists."</p>

<p>"And they have a large dog with them," said Tortillard.</p>

<p>"Bah! bah! If it was only that, I could break the
brute's skull with a blow of my shoe-heel," said the
Chouette.</p>

<p>"Here they are," replied Tortillard, who was listening
still to the echo of their footsteps. "They are coming
down the hollow now."</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak, <i>fourline?</i>" said the Chouette
to the Schoolmaster. "What is best to be done, long-headed
as you are, eh? Are you grown dumb?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done to-day," replied the
miscreant.</p>

<p>"And the thousand 'bob' of the man in mourning,"
said the Chouette; "they are gone, then? I'd sooner&mdash;Your
knife&mdash;your knife, <i>fourline!</i> I will stick the
companion, that she may be no trouble to us; and, as to
the young miss, Tortillard and I can make off with her."</p>

<p>"But the man in mourning does not desire that we
should kill any one."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we must put the cold meat down as an
extra in his bill. He must pay, for he will be an accomplice
with us."</p>

<p>"Here they come&mdash;down the hill," said Tortillard,
softly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your knife, lad!" said the Chouette, in a similar
tone.</p>

<p>"Ah, Chouette," cried Tortillard, in alarm, and extending
his hands to the hag, "that is too bad&mdash;to kill.
No!&mdash;oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Your knife, I tell you!" repeated the Chouette, in
an undertone, without paying the least attention to Tortillard's
supplication, and putting her shoes off hastily.
"I have taken off my shoes," she added, "that I may
steal on them quietly from behind. It is almost dark;
but I can easily make out the little one by her cloak, and
I will do for the other."</p>

<p>"No," said the felon; "to-day it is useless. There
will be plenty of time to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What! you're afraid, old patterer, are you?" said
the Chouette, with fierce contempt.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the Schoolmaster. "But you
may fail in your blow and spoil all."</p>

<p>The dog which accompanied the country-woman, scenting
the persons hidden in the hollow road, stopped short,
and barked furiously, refusing to come to Fleur-de-Marie,
who called him frequently.</p>

<p>"Do you hear their dog? Here they are! Your
knife!&mdash;or, if not&mdash;" cried the Chouette, with a threatening
air.</p>

<p>"Come and take it from me, then&mdash;by force," said
the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"It's all over&mdash;it's too late," added the Chouette,
after listening for a moment attentively; "they have
gone by. You shall pay for that, gallows-bird," added
she, furiously, shaking her fist at her accomplice. "A
thousand francs lost by your stupidity!"</p>

<p>"A thousand&mdash;two thousand&mdash;perhaps three thousand
gained," replied the Schoolmaster, in a tone of authority.
"Listen, Chouette! Do you go back to Barbillon,
and let him drive you to the place where you were to
meet the man in mourning. Tell him that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to do anything to-day, but that to-morrow she
shall be carried off. The young girl goes every evening
to walk home with the priest, and it was only a chance
which to-day led her to meet with any one. To-morrow
we shall have a more secure opportunity. So to-morrow
do you return and be with Barbillon at the cross-road in
his coach at the same hour."</p>

<p>"But thou&mdash;thou?"</p>

<p>"Tortillard shall lead me to the farm where the young
girl lives. I will cook up some tale&mdash;say we have lost
our road, and ask leave to pass the night at the farm in
a corner of the stable. No one could refuse us that.
Tortillard will examine all the doors, windows, and ins
and outs of the house. There is always money to be
looked for amongst these farming people. You say the
farm is situated in a lone spot; and, when once we know
all the ways and outlets, we need only return with some
safe friends, and the thing is done as easy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always 'downy!' What a head-piece!" said the
Chouette, softening. "Go on, <i>fourline</i>."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning, instead of leaving the farm, I
will complain of a pain which prevents me from walking.
If they will not believe me, I'll show them the wound
which I have always had since I smashed the 'loop of
my darbies,' and which is always painful to me. I'll say
it is a burn I had from a red-hot bar when I was a workman,
and they'll believe me. I'll remain at the farm
part of the day, whilst Tortillard looks about him.
When the evening comes on, and the little wench goes
out as usual with the priest, I'll say I'm better, and fit to
go away. Tortillard and I will follow the young wench
at a distance, and await your coming to us here. As she
will know us already, she will have no mistrust when she
sees us. We will speak to her, Tortillard and I; and,
when once within reach of my arms, I will answer for
the rest. She's caught safe enough, and the thousand
francs are ours. That is not all. In two or three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
we can 'give the office' of the farm to Barbillon and some
others, and share with them if they get any 'swag,' as
it will be me who put them on the 'lay.'"</p>

<p>"Well done, No-Eyes! No one can come up to you,"
said the Chouette, embracing the Schoolmaster. "Your
plan is capital! Tell you what, <i>fourline</i>, when you are
done up and old, you must turn consulting 'prig'; you
will earn as much money as a 'big-wig.' Come, kiss
your old woman, and be off as quick as you may, for
these joskins go to sleep with their poultry. I shall go
to Barbillon; and to-morrow, at four o'clock, we will be
at the cross-road with the 'trap,' unless he is nabbed for
having assisted Gros-Boiteux and the Skeleton to 'do
for' the milk-woman's husband in the Rue de la Vieille-Draperie.
But if he can't come, another can, for the
pretended hackney-coach belongs to the man in mourning
who has used it before. A quarter of an hour after
we get to the cross-road, I will be here and wait for
you."</p>

<p>"All right! Good-by till to-morrow, Chouette."</p>

<p>"I had nearly forgot to give the wax to Tortillard, if
there is any lock to get the print of at the farm. Here,
chickabiddy, do you know how to use it?" said the one-eyed
wretch to Tortillard, as she gave him a piece of
wax.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my father showed me how to use it. I
took for him the print of the lock of the little iron chest
which my master, the quack doctor, keeps in his small
closet."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's all right; and, that the wax may not
stick, do not forget to moisten the wax after you have
warmed it well in your hand."</p>

<p>"I know all about it," replied Tortillard.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, them, <i>fourline</i>," said the Chouette.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," replied the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The Chouette went towards the coach. The Schoolmaster
and Tortillard quitted the hollow way, and bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
their steps towards the farm, the lights which shone from
the windows serving to guide them on their way.</p>

<p>Strange fatality, which again brought Anselm Duresnel
under the same roof with his wife, who had not seen
him since his condemnation to hard labour for life!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h5>AN EVENING AT THE FARM.</h5>


<p>Perhaps a more gratifying sight does not exist than
the interior of a large farm-kitchen prepared for the
evening meal, especially during the winter season. Its
bright wood fire, the long table covered with the savoury,
smoking dishes, the huge tankards of foaming beer or
cider, with the happy countenances scattered round,
speak of peaceful labour and healthful industry. The
farm-kitchen of Bouqueval was a fine exemplification of
this remark. Its immense open chimney, about six feet
high and eight feet wide, resembled the yawning mouth
of some huge oven. On the hearth blazed and sparkled
enormous logs of beech or oak; and from this prodigious
brazier there issued forth such a body of light, as well
as heat, that the large lamp suspended from the centre
beam sunk into insignificance, and was rendered nearly
useless. Every variety of culinary utensils, sparkling in
all the brightness of the most elaborate cleanliness, and
composed invariably of copper, brass, and tin, glowed in
the bright radiance of the winter fire, as they stood
ranged with the utmost nicety and effect on their appropriate
shelves. An old-fashioned cistern of elaborately
polished copper showed its bright face, polished as a
mirror; and close beside stood a highly polished bread-trough
and cover, composed of walnut-tree wood, rubbed
by the hand of housewifery till you could see your face
in it and from which issued a most tempting smell of
hot bread. A long and substantial table occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
centre of the kitchen; a tablecloth, which, though coarse
in texture, vied with the falling snow for whiteness, covered
its entire length; while for each expected guest was
placed an earthenware plate, brown without, but white
within, and by its side a knife, fork, and spoon, lustrous
as silver itself. In the midst of the table, an immense
tureen of vegetable soup smoked like the crater of a
volcano, and diffused its savoury vapours over a dish of
ham and greens, flanked by a most formidable array
of mutton, most relishly stewed with onions and potatoes.
Below was placed a large joint of roast veal, followed by
two great plates of winter salad, supported by a couple
of baskets of apples; and a similar number of cheeses
completed the arrangements of the table. Three or four
stone pitchers filled with sparkling cider, and a like
quantity of loaves of brown bread, equal in size to the
stones of a windmill, were placed at the discretionary
use of the supping party.</p>

<p>An old, shaggy, black shepherd dog, almost toothless,
the superannuated patriarch of all the canine tribe
employed on the farm, was, by reason of his great age
and long services, indulged with permission to enjoy the
cheering warmth of the chimney-corner; but, using his
privilege with the utmost modesty and discretion, this
venerable servitor, who answered to the pastoral name
of Lysander, lay quietly stretched out in a secure side-nook,
his nose resting on his paws, watching with the
deepest attention the various culinary preparations which
preceded the supper.</p>

<p>The bill of fare thus presented to the reader, as the
ordinary mode of living at the farm of Bouqueval, may
strike some of our readers as unnecessarily sumptuous;
but Madame Georges, faithfully following out the wishes
of Rodolph, endeavoured by all possible means to improve
the comforts of the labourers on the farm, who
were always selected as being the most worthy and
industrious individuals of their district. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
well paid, liberally treated, and so kindly used that
to be engaged on the Bouqueval farm was the highest
ambition of all the best labourers in that part of the
country&mdash;an ambition which most essentially promoted
the welfare and advantage of the masters they then
served; for no applicant for employment at Bouqueval
could obtain a favourable hearing, unless he came provided
with most satisfactory testimonials from his last
employer.</p>

<p>Thus, though on a very small scale, had Rodolph
created a species of model farm, which had for its aim
not only the improvement of animals and agricultural
operations, but, above all, improving the nature of man
himself; and this he effected by making it worth their
while to be active, honest, and intelligent.</p>

<p>After having completed all the preparations for supper,
and placed on the table a jug of wine to accompany the
dessert, the farm-cook sounded the welcome tocsin, which
told all that the cheering meal was prepared, and, their
evening toil concluded, they might freely enjoy the
delights of wholesome and temperate refreshment. Ere
the sound had ceased to vibrate on the ear, a merry,
joyous throng, composed of men and maidens to the
number of twelve or fifteen, crowded around the table;
the men had open, manly countenances, the women
looked healthy and good-humoured, while the young
girls belonging to the party wore the brightest glow of
youth and innocence. Every face was lighted up with
frank gaiety, content, and the satisfaction arising from
the consciousness of having well fulfilled one's duty.
Thus happily prepared in mind and body to do justice
to the excellent fare set before them, the happy party
took their appointed places at table.</p>

<p>The upper end was occupied by an old, white-haired
labourer, whose fine, bold, yet sensible expression of
face, bespoke him a descendant of the ancient Gaulish
mothers of the soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Châtelain (for so was this Nestor called) had
worked on the farm from his early childhood. When
Rodolph purchased the farm, the old servant had been
strongly recommended to him, and he was forthwith
raised to the rank of overlooker, and, under the orders
of Madame Georges, general superintendent of all outdoor
work; and unbounded, indeed, was the influence
possessed by Father Châtelain by virtue of his age,
his knowledge, and experience.</p>

<p>Every one having taken their seat, Father Châtelain,
having fervently invoked a blessing, then, in pursuance
of an ancient and pious custom, marked one of the
loaves with the figure of a cross, and cut off a large
slice as the share of the Virgin or the poor, then,
pouring out a glass of wine with a similar consecration
to charitable purposes, he reverently placed both bread
and wine on a plate placed in the centre of the table
purposely to receive them. At this moment the yard
dogs barked furiously; old Lysander replied by a low
growl, and, curling back his upper lip, displayed two
or three still formidable fangs.</p>

<p>"Some person is passing near the wall of the courtyard,"
observed Father Châtelain.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words been uttered, than the bell of
the great gate sounded.</p>

<p>"Who can this possibly be at so late an hour?" said
the old labourer; "every one belonging to the place is
in. Go and see who it is, Jean René."</p>

<p>The individual thus addressed was a stout, able-bodied
young labourer on the farm, who was then
busily employed blowing his scalding hot soup, with a
force of lungs that Æolus himself might have envied;
but, used to prompt obedience, in a moment the half-raised
spoon was deposited in its place, and, half stifling
a sigh of regret, he departed on his errand.</p>

<p>"This is the first time our good Madame Georges
and Mlle. Marie have failed paying a visit to the warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
chimney-corner, and looking on whilst we took our
supper, for this long time," said Father Châtelain.
"I am hungry as a hunter, but I shall not relish my
supper half so well."</p>

<p>"Madame Georges is in the chamber of Mlle. Marie,
who found herself somewhat indisposed on her return
from escorting M. le Curé to the rectory," replied
Claudine, the girl who had conducted La Goualeuse back
from the rectory, and thus unconsciously frustrated the
evil designs of the Chouette.</p>

<p>"I trust Mlle. Marie is only indisposed, not seriously
ill, is she, Claudine?" inquired the old man, with almost
paternal anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, Father Châtelain! God forbid! I hope
and believe our dear mademoiselle is only just a little
struck with the cold of the night, and her walk perhaps
fatigued her. I trust she will be quite well by to-morrow;
indeed Madame Georges told me as much, and
said that, if she had had any fears, she should have sent
to Paris for M. David, the negro doctor, who took such
care of mademoiselle when she was so ill. Well, I
cannot make out how any one can endure a black doctor!
For my part I should not have the slightest confidence in
anything he said or did. No, no! if one must have a
doctor, let it be a Christian man with a white skin; but
a downright blackamoor! O saints above! why, the
very sight of him by my bedside would kill me!"</p>

<p>"But did not this Monsieur David cure Mlle. Marie
from the long illness with which she suffered when she
first came here?" inquired the old man.</p>

<p>"Yes, Father Châtelain, he certainly did."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Ah! but for all that, Father Châtelain, a doctor with
a black face is enough to terrify any one&mdash;I should
scream myself into fits if he were to come rolling up the
great whites of his eyes at me."</p>

<p>"But is not this M. David the same person who cured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Dame Anica of that dreadful wound in her leg, which
had confined her to her bed for upwards of three years?"</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly so, Father Châtelain; he certainly did
set old Dame Anica up again."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my child?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but only think!&mdash;a black man! and when one
is ill, too! when one can so ill bear up against such
horrid things. If he were only a little dark, or even
deep brown, but quite, quite a black&mdash;all black&mdash;oh,
Father Châtelain, I really cannot bring myself to think
of it!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, my child, what colour is your favourite
heifer Musette?"</p>

<p>"Oh, white&mdash;white as a swan, Father Châtelain; and
such a milcher! I can say that for the poor thing without
the least falsehood, a better cow we have not got on
the farm."</p>

<p>"And your other favourite, Rosette?"</p>

<p>"Rosette? Oh, she is as black as a raven, not one
white hair about her I should say; and, indeed, to do her
justice, she is a first-rate milcher also. I hardly know
which is the best, she or my pretty Musette."</p>

<p>"And what coloured milk does she give?"</p>

<p>"Why, white, of course, Father Châtelain; I really
thought you knew that."</p>

<p>"Is her milk as white and as good as the milk of your
snowy pet, Musette?"</p>

<p>"Every bit as good in colour and quality."</p>

<p>"Although Rosette is a black cow?"</p>

<p>"To be sure! why, Father Châtelain, what difference
can it possibly make to the milk whether the cow that
gives it is black, white, red, or brown?"</p>

<p>"How, then, my good girl, can it in any way signify
whether a doctor has a black or white skin, or what his
complexion may be?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Claudine, fairly hunted into a corner
from which no argument could rescue her,&mdash;"well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
as regards what makes a black doctor not so good as a
white one, it is&mdash;it is, because a black skin is so very
ugly to look at, and a white one is so much more agreeable
to one's eyes; I'm sure I can't think of any other
reason, Father Châtelain, if I try for ever; but with
cows the colour of the skin makes not the very least
difference, of that you may be assured; but, then, you
know there's a deal of difference between a cow and a
man."</p>

<p>These not very clear physiognomical reflections of
Claudine, touching the effect of light or dark skins in
the human and animal race, were interrupted by the
return of Jean René, blowing his fingers with animation
as he had before blown his soup.</p>

<p>"Oh, how cold! how cold it is this night!" exclaimed
he, on entering; "it is enough to freeze one to death; it
is a pretty deal more snug and comfortable in-doors than
out this bitter night. Oh, how cold it is!"</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The frost that cometh from North and East</span><br />
<span class="i0h">Biteth the most and ceaseth the least.'</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Don't you know that, my lad?" said the old superintendent
Châtelain. "But who was it that rang so late?"</p>

<p>"A poor blind man and a boy who leads him about,
Father Châtelain."</p>

<p>"And what does this poor blind man want?" inquired
Châtelain.</p>

<p>"The poor man and his son were going by the cross-road
to Louvres, and have lost themselves in the snow;
and as the cold is enough to turn a man into an icicle,
and the night is pitch dark, the poor blind father has
come to entreat permission for himself and lad to pass
the night on the farm; he says he shall be for ever
thankful for leave to lie on a little straw under a hovel,
or in any out-building."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, as for that, I am quite sure that Madame
Georges, who never refuses charity to any unfortunate
being, will willingly permit them to do so; but
we must first acquaint her with it; go, Claudine, and
tell her the whole story." Claudine disappeared.</p>

<p>"And where is this poor man waiting?" asked Father
Châtelain.</p>

<p>"In the little barn just by."</p>

<p>"But why in the barn? why put him there?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, if I had left him in the yard, the dogs
would have eaten him up alive! Why, Father Châtelain,
it was no use for me to call out 'Quiet, Médor!
come here, Turk! down, Sultan!' I never saw dogs in
such a fury. And, besides, we don't use our dogs on the
farm to fly at poor folks, as they are trained to do at
other places."</p>

<p>"Well, my lads, it seems that the 'share for the poor'
has not been laid aside in vain to-night. But try and sit
a little closer; there, that'll do; now put two more
plates and knives and forks for this blind traveller and
his boy, for I feel quite certain what Madame Georges's
answer will be, and that she will desire them to be
housed here for the night."</p>

<p>"It is really a thing I can't make out," said Jean
René, "about the dogs being so very violent, especially
Turk, who went with Claudine this evening to the rectory.
Why, when I stroked him, to try and pacify him,
I felt his coat standing up on end like so many bristles
of a porcupine. Now, what do you say to that, eh,
Father Châtelain&mdash;you who know almost everything?"</p>

<p>"Why, my lad, I, 'who know everything,' say just this,
that the beasts know far more than I do, and can see
farther. I remember, in the autumn, when the heavy
rains had so swollen the little river, I was returning
with my team-horses one dark night&mdash;I was riding
upon Cuckoo, the old roan horse, and deuce take me
if I could make out any spot it would be safe to wade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
through, for the night was as dark as the mouth of a
pit. Well, I threw the bridle on old Cuckoo's back, and
he soon found what, I'll answer for it, none of us could
have discovered. Now, who taught the dumb brute to
know the safe from the unsafe parts of the stream, let
me ask you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Father Châtelain, that's what I was waiting to
ask you. Who taught the old roan to discover danger
and escape from it so cleverly?"</p>

<p>"The same Almighty wisdom which instructs the
swallow to build in our chimneys, and guides the marten
to make his nest among the reeds of our banks, my lad.
Well, Claudine," said the ancient oracle of the kitchen
to the blooming dairymaid, who just then entered, bearing
on her arms two pairs of snowy white sheets, from
which an odoriferous smell of sage and thyme was wafted
along,&mdash;"well, I make no doubt but Madame Georges
has sent permission for these poor creatures, the blind
man and his child, to sleep here, has she not?"</p>

<p>"These sheets are to prepare beds for them, in the
little room at the end of the passage," said Claudine.</p>

<p>"Go and bid them come in, then, Jean René; and you,
Claudine, my good girl, put a couple of chairs near the
fire&mdash;they will be glad of a good warm before sitting
down to table."</p>

<p>The furious barking of the dogs was now renewed,
mingled with the voice of Jean René, who was endeavoring
to pacify them; the door of the kitchen was abruptly
opened, and the Schoolmaster and Tortillard entered with
as much precipitation as though they feared a pursuit
from some dangerous foe.</p>

<p>"For the love of heaven, keep off your dogs!" cried
the Schoolmaster, in the utmost terror; "they have been
trying to bite us!"</p>

<p>"They have torn a great bit out of my blouse,"
whined Tortillard, shivering with cold and pale with
fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, good man," said Jean René,
shutting the door securely; "but I never before saw
our dogs in such a perfect fury&mdash;it must be the cold
makes them so spiteful; perhaps, being half frozen, they
fancied biting you would serve to warm them&mdash;there
is no knowing what mere animals may mean by what
they do."</p>

<p>"Why, are you going to begin, too?" exclaimed the
old farmer, as Lysander, who had hitherto lain perfectly
happy in the radiance of the glowing fire, started up,
and, growling fiercely, was about to fly at the strangers.
"This old dog is quiet enough, but, having heard the
other dogs make such a furious noise, he thinks he must
do the same. Will you lie down and be quiet, you old
brute? Do you hear, sir? lie down!"</p>

<p>At these words from Father Châtelain, accompanied
by a significant motion of the foot, Lysander, with a
low, deep growl of dissatisfaction, slowly returned to his
favourite corner by the hearth, while the Schoolmaster
and Tortillard remained trembling by the kitchen-door,
as though fearful of approaching farther. The features
of the ruffian were so hideous, from the frightful effects
produced by the cold, that some of the servants in the
kitchen shuddered with alarm, while others recoiled in
disgust; this impression was not lost on Tortillard, who
felt reassured by the terrors of the villagers, and even
felt proud of the repulsiveness of his companion. This
first confusion over, Father Châtelain, thinking only of
worthily discharging the duties of hospitality, said to the
Schoolmaster:</p>

<p>"Come, my good friend&mdash;come near the fire and
warm yourself thoroughly, and then you shall have some
supper with us; for you happened to come very fortunately,
just as we were sitting down to table. Here, sit
down, just where I have placed your chair. But what
am I thinking about?" added the worthy old labourer.
"I ought to have spoken to your son, not you, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that it has pleased God to take away your eyesight&mdash;a
heavy loss, a heavy loss; but let us hope all for your
good, my friend, though you may not now think so.
Here, my boy, lead your father to that snug place in the
chimney-corner."</p>

<p>"Yes, kind sir," drawled out Tortillard, with a nasal
twang and canting, hypocritical tone; "may God bless
you for your charity to the poor blind! Here, father,
take my arm; lean on my shoulder, father; take care,
take care, gently;" and, with affected zeal and tenderness,
the urchin guided the steps of the brigand till they
reached the indicated spot. As the pair approached
Lysander, he uttered a low, growling noise; but as the
Schoolmaster brushed past him, and the sagacious animal
had full scent of his garments, he broke out into one
of those deep howls with which, it is asserted by the superstitious,
dogs frequently announce an approaching death.</p>

<p>"What, in the devil's name, do all these cursed animals
mean by their confounded noise?" said the Schoolmaster
to himself. "Can they smell the blood on my
clothes, I wonder? for I now recollect I wore the
trousers I have on at present the night the cattle-dealer
was murdered."</p>

<p>"Did you notice that?" inquired Jean René of Father
Châtelain. "Why, I vow that, as often as old Lysander
had caught scent of the wandering stranger, he actually
set up a regular death-howl."</p>

<p>And this remark was followed up by a most singular
confirmation of the fact; the cries of Lysander were so
loud and mournful that the other dogs caught the sound
(for the farmyard was only separated from the kitchen
by a glazed window in the latter), and, according to the
custom of the canine race, they each strove who should
outdo the other in repeating and prolonging the funereal
wail, which, according to vulgar belief, always foretells
death. Though but little given to superstitious dread,
the farm-people looked from one to another with a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of wonder not unmixed with awe. Even the Schoolmaster
himself, diabolically hardened as he was, felt a
cold shudder steal over him at the thought that all these
fatal sounds burst forth upon the approach of him&mdash;the
self-convicted murderer! while Tortillard, too audacious
and hardened to enter into such alarms, with all the
infidelity in which he had been trained, even from his
mother's arms, looked on with delighted mockery at the
universal panic, and was, perhaps, the only person present
devoid of an uneasy feeling; but, once freed from
his apprehensions of suffering from the violence of the
animals, he listened even with pleasure to the horrible
discord of their long-drawn-out wailings, and felt almost
tempted to pardon them the fright they had originally
occasioned him, in consideration of the perfect terror
they had struck into the inhabitants of the farm, and for
the gratification he derived from the convulsive horror
of the Schoolmaster. But after the momentary stupor
had passed away Jean René again quitted the kitchen,
and the loud cracking of his whip soon put an end to
the prophetic howlings of Médor, Turk, and Sultan, and
quickly dispersed them to their separate kennels, and as
the noise ceased, the gloomy cloud passed away from
the kitchen, and the peasants looked up with the same
honest cheerfulness they had worn upon the entrance of
the two travellers. Ere long they had left off wondering
at the repulsive ugliness of the Schoolmaster, and
only thought with pity of his great affliction, in being
blind; they commiserated the lameness of the poor boy,
admired the interesting sharpness of his countenance,
the deep, cute glance of his ever-moving eye, and, above
all, loaded him with praises for the extreme care and
watchfulness with which he attended to his afflicted
parent. The appetite of the labourers, which had been
momentarily forgotten, now returned with redoubled
violence, and for a time nothing could be heard but the
clattering of plates and rattling of knives and forks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Still, however busily employed with their suppers, the
servants assembled round the table, both male and
female, could not but remark, with infinite pleasure, the
tender assiduity of the lad towards the blind creature
who sat beside him. Nothing could exceed the devoted
affection and filial care with which Tortillard prepared
his meat for him, cutting both that and his bread with
most accurate nicety, pouring out his drink, and never
attempting even to taste a morsel himself, till his father
expressed himself as having completed his supper. But,
for all this dutiful attention, the young ruffian took
ample and bitter revenge. Instigated as much by an
innate spirit of cruelty as the desire of imitation natural
to his age, Tortillard found an equal enjoyment with
the Chouette in having something to torment (<i>a bête de
souffrance</i>); and it was a matter of inexpressible exultation
to his wretched mind that he, a poor, distorted,
crippled, abject creature, should have it in his power
to tyrannise over so powerful and ferocious a creature as
the Schoolmaster,&mdash;it was like torturing a muzzled
tiger. He even refined his gratification, by compelling
his victim to endure all the agonies he inflicted, without
wincing or exhibiting the slightest external sign of his
suffering. Thus he accompanied each outward mark of
devoted tenderness towards his supposed parent, by aiming
a severe kick against the Schoolmaster's legs, on one
of which there was (in common with many who had
long worked in the galleys) a deep and severe wound, the
effect of the heavy iron chain worn during the term of
punishment around the right leg; and, by way of compelling
the miserable sufferer to exercise a greater
degree of stoical courage, the urchin always seized the
moment when the object of his malice was either drinking
or speaking.</p>

<p>"Here, dear father! here is a nice peeled nut," said
Tortillard, placing on the plate of his supposed parent a
nut carefully prepared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good boy," said old Châtelain, smiling kindly at
him. Then, addressing the bandit, he added: "However
great may be your affliction, my friend, so good a son is
almost sufficient to make up even for the loss of sight;
but Providence is so gracious, he never takes away one
blessing without sending another."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, kind sir! My lot is a very
hard one, and, but for the noble conduct of my excellent
child, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sharp cry of irrepressible anguish here broke from
the quivering lips of the tortured man; the son of Bras
Rouge had this time aimed his blow so effectually, that
the point of his heavy-nailed shoe had reached the very
centre of the wound, and produced unendurable agony.</p>

<p>"Father! dear father! what is the matter?" exclaimed
Tortillard, in a whimpering voice; then, suddenly
rising, he threw both his arms round the Schoolmaster's
neck, whose first impulse of rage and pain was to stifle
the limping varlet in his Herculean grasp; and so powerfully
did he compress the boy's chest against his own,
that his impeded respiration vented itself in a low moaning
sound. A few minutes, and Tortillard's last prank
would have been played; but, reflecting that the lad
was for the present indispensable to the furtherance of
the schemes he had on hand, the Schoolmaster, by a
violent effort, controlled his desire to annihilate his tormentor,
and contented himself with pushing him off his
shoulders back into his own chair. The sympathising
group around the table were far from seeing through all
this, and merely considered these close embraces as an
interchange of paternal and filial tenderness, while the
half suffocation and deadly pallor of Tortillard they
attributed to emotion caused by the sudden illness of his
beloved father.</p>

<p>"What ailed you just now, my good man?" inquired
Father Châtelain; "only see, you have quite frightened
your poor boy. Why, he looks pale as death, and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
scarcely breathe. Come, my little man; you must not
take on so&mdash;your father is all right again."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen all," replied the
Schoolmaster, controlling himself with much difficulty,
for the pain he was still enduring was most excruciating.
"I am better now. I'll tell you, with your kind leaves,
all about it. You see I am by trade a working locksmith,
and, one day that I was employed in beating out
a huge bar of red hot iron, it fell over on my two legs,
and burnt them so dreadfully that it has never healed;
unfortunately, just now, I happened to strike the leg
that is worst against the table, and the sudden agony it
occasioned me drew forth the sudden cry which so much
disturbed all this good company, and for which I humbly
beg pardon."</p>

<p>"Poor dear father!" whined out Tortillard, casting a
look of fiendish malice at the shivering Schoolmaster, and
wholly recovered from his late attack of excessive emotion.
"Poor father! you have indeed got a bad leg
nobody can cure. Ah, kind gentlemen, I hope you will
never have such a shocking wound, and be obliged to
hear all the doctors say it never will get well. No!
never&mdash;never. Oh, my dear, dear father! how I wish
I could but suffer the pain instead of you!"</p>

<p>At this tender, moving speech, the females present
expressed the utmost admiration for the dutiful speaker,
and began feeling in their vast pockets for some more
substantial mark of their regard.</p>

<p>"It is unlucky, my honest friend," said old Châtelain,
addressing the Schoolmaster, "you had not happened to
come to this farm about three weeks ago, instead of
to-night."</p>

<p>"And why so, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Because we had staying for a few days in the house
a celebrated Paris doctor, who has an infallible remedy
for all diseases of the legs. A worthy old woman, belonging
to our village, had been confined to her bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
upwards of three years with some affection of the legs.
Well, this doctor, being here, as I said, heard of the
case, applied an unguent to the wounds, and now,
bless you, she is as surefooted, ay, and as swift, too, as
any of our young girls; and the first holiday she makes
she intends walking to the house of her benefactor, in
the Allée des Veuves, at Paris, to return her grateful
thanks. To be sure it is a good step from hence, but
then, as Mother Anica says&mdash;Why, what has come over
you again, my friend? Is your leg still so painful?"</p>

<p>The mention of the Allée des Veuves had recalled
such frightful recollections to the Schoolmaster, that,
involuntarily, a cold shudder shook his frame, while a
fearful spasm, by contracting his ghastly countenance,
made it appear still more hideous.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he, trying to conceal his emotion, "a
sudden darting pain seized me, and&mdash;Pray excuse my
interrupting your kind and sensible discourse, and be
pleased to proceed."</p>

<p>"It really is a great pity," resumed the old labourer,
"that this excellent doctor should not be with us at
present; but I tell you what, he is as good as he is
skilful, and I am quite sure if you let your little lad
conduct you to his house when you return to Paris,
that he will cure you. His address is not difficult to
recollect, it is 17 Allée des Veuves. Even should you
forget the number, it will not matter, for there are but
very few doctors in the neighbourhood, and no other
negro surgeon,&mdash;for, only imagine, this clever, kind,
and charitable man is a black, but his heart is white and
good. His name is David,&mdash;Doctor David,&mdash;you will
be able to remember that name, I dare say."</p>

<p>The features of the Schoolmaster were so seamed and
scarred that it was difficult to perceive when his colour
varied. He did, however, on the present occasion, turn
ghastly pale as he first heard the exact number mentioned
of Rodolph's house, and afterwards the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of the black doctor,&mdash;of David, the negro surgeon,
who, by Rodolph's orders, had inflicted on him the fearful
punishment, the terrible results of which were each
hour more painfully developed. Father Châtelain, however,
was too much interested in his subject to notice
the deadly paleness of the Schoolmaster, and proceeded
with his discourse:</p>

<p>"When you leave us, my poor fellow, we will be sure
to write his address on a slip of paper and give it to your
son, for I know that, besides putting you in a certain way
to be cured of your painful wound, it would be gratifying
to M. David to be able to relieve your sufferings. Oh, he
is so good,&mdash;never so happy as when he has rendered
any person a service. I wish he had not always that
mournful and dejected look. I fear he has some heavy
care near his heart; and he is so good, so full of pity
for all who suffer. Well, well, Providence will bless
him in another world; but come, friend, let us drink to
the health and happiness of your future benefactor,&mdash;here
take this mug."</p>

<p>"No, thank you!" returned the Schoolmaster, with a
gloomy air; "none for me. I&mdash;I am not thirsty, and
I never drink unless I am."</p>

<p>"Nay, friend, but this is good old wine I have poured
out for you; not cider," said the labourer. "Many
tradespeople do not drink as good. Bless your heart,
this farm is not conducted as other farms are,&mdash;what
do you think of our style of living, by the by? have you
relished your supper?"</p>

<p>"All very good," responded the Schoolmaster mechanically,
more and more absorbed in the painfulness
of his ideas.</p>

<p>"Well, then, as we live one day, so we do another.
We work well, we live well, we have a good conscience,
and an equally good bed to rest upon after the labours of
the day. Our lives roll on in peace and contentment.
There are seven labourers constantly employed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
farm, who are paid almost double wages to what others
get; but then I can venture to assert, that if we are paid
double, we do as much work among us as fourteen ordinary
labourers would do. The mere husbandry servants
have one hundred and fifty crowns a year, the dairy-women
and other females engaged about the place sixty
crowns, and a tenth share of the produce of the farm is
divided among us all. You may suppose we do not
idle away much time, or fail to make hay while the
sun shines, for Nature is a bountiful mother, and
ever returns a hundredfold to those who assiduously
seek her favour; the more we give her, the more she
returns."</p>

<p>"Your master cannot get very rich if he treats you
and pays you thus liberally," said the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Oh, our master is different to all others, and has a
mode of repaying himself peculiarly his own."</p>

<p>"From what you say," answered the blind man, hoping
by engaging in conversation to escape from the
gloominess of his own thoughts, "your master must be
a very extraordinary person."</p>

<p>"Indeed he is, my good man, a most uncommon
master to meet with. Now, as chance has brought you
among us, and a strange though a lucky chance for you
it has proved, lying out of the highroad as this village
does, it is so very seldom any stranger ever finds it out.
Well, I was going to say, here you are, and no fault to
find with your quarters, is there? Now, in all human
probability, when you turn your back upon the place
you will never return to it, but you shall not depart
without hearing from me a description of our master
and all he has done for the farm, upon condition that
you promise to repeat it again wherever you go, and to
whomsoever you may meet with. You will see, I mean,
I beg pardon, you will then be able to understand."</p>

<p>"I listen to you," answered the Schoolmaster; "proceed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I can promise you you will not be throwing
away your time by listening," replied the venerable
Châtelain. "Now, one day our master thought all at
once: 'Here am I, rich enough to eat two dinners a day
if I liked, but I don't. Now, suppose I were to provide
a meal for those who have none at all, and enable such
as can hardly procure half a dinner to enjoy as much
good food as they desired, would not that be better than
over-indulging myself? So it shall be,' says he, and
away he goes to work, and, first thing, he buys this farm,
which was not much of a concern then, and scarcely
kept a couple of ploughs at work; and, being born and
bred on the place, I ought to know something about it.
Next, master made considerable additions to the farm.
I'll tell you all about that by and by. At the head of
the farm he placed a most worthy and respectable female,
who had known a great deal of trouble in her past life&mdash;master
always chose out people for their goodness
and their misfortunes&mdash;and, when he brought the person
I am telling you of here, he said to her in my hearing,
'I wish this place to be like the Temple of our
great Maker, open to the deserving and the afflicted, but
closed against the wicked and hardened reprobate.' So
idle beggars are always turned from the gate; but those
who are able and willing to work have always the opportunity
set before them: the charity of labour, our master
says, is no humiliation to him who receives it, but a favour
and service conferred on the person whose labour is thus
done; and the rich man who does not act upon this
principle but ill employs his wealth. So said our master.
But he did more than talk&mdash;he acted. There
was formerly a road from here to Ecouen, which cut off
a good mile of distance, but, Lord love you! it was one
great rutty bog, impossible to get up or down it; it was
the death of every horse, and certain destruction to
every vehicle that attempted to pass through it. A little
labour, and a trifling amount of money from each farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in the adjoining country would soon have repaired the
road; but they never could be brought to any unanimity
on the subject, and, in proportion as one farmer would
be anxious to contribute towards putting the road in
order, the others would invariably decline sending either
men or money to assist. So our master, perceiving all
this, said, 'The road shall be repaired; but as those
who can afford to contribute will not, and as it is more
for convenience and accommodation to the rich than necessity
for the poor, it shall first become useful to those
who would work if they could get it to do, who have
heart, and hands, and courage, but no employ. Well,
this road shall be reserved as a constant occupation for
persons of this description. Horsemen and carriages
belonging to the rich and affluent, who care not how
roads are repaired, so that they can travel at their ease,
may go round by the farther side.' So, for example,
whenever a strong, sturdy fellow presented himself at
the farm, pleading hunger and want of work, I'd say to
him, 'Here, my lad; here is a basin of warm nourishing
soup&mdash;take it and welcome; then, if you wish for
work, here is a pickaxe and spade; one of our people
will show you the Ecouen road; make every day twelve
feet of it good, by spreading and breaking the flints;
and every evening, after your work is examined, you
shall receive at the rate of forty sous for the quantity
named; twenty sous for half as much; ten sous for
a quarter; for less than that, nothing at all.' Then,
towards evening, upon my return from labour, I used to
go on the road, measure their work, and examine
whether it was well done."</p>

<p>"And only to think," interposed Jean René, in a fit
of virtuous indignation, "only think, now, of there coming
two heartless vagabonds, who drank their soup and
walked off with the pickaxe and shovel. It is enough
to sicken one of doing good or trying to benefit one's
fellow creatures."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite right, Master René," exclaimed the other labourers;
"so it is."</p>

<p>"Come, come, lads," resumed Father Châtelain, "don't
be too warm. Just see here. We might as well say it
is useless to plant trees, or sow grain, because there are
caterpillars, weevils, and other injurious insects that gnaw
the leaves or devour the seeds put in the ground. No,
no! we destroy the vermin. But God Almighty, who is
no niggard, causes fresh buds to burst forth and new
ears of corn to sprout; the damage is abundantly repaired,
and no trace remains of the mischievous insects
which have passed over our work. Am I not right, my
friend?" said the old labourer, addressing the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"No doubt&mdash;no doubt," replied the latter, who had
appeared for some time past lost in a train of serious
meditation.</p>

<p>"Then, as for women and children, there is plenty of
occupation for them also, according to their age and
strength," added Father Châtelain.</p>

<p>"Yet, spite of all this," observed Claudine, joining in
the conversation, "the road gets on but very slowly."</p>

<p>"Which only goes to prove, my good girl, that in this
part of the country there is happily no scarcity of employment
for the honest and industrious labourer."</p>

<p>"But now, as in the case of a poor, helpless, afflicted
creature such as I am," said the Schoolmaster, hastily,
"would not the worthy owner of the farm grant me a
humble corner in it for charity's sake&mdash;a shelter and a
morsel of bread for the little while I have to remain
a burden to any one in this troublesome world? Oh,
my worthy sir, could I but obtain such a boon I would
pass the remainder of my days in praying for a blessing
on my benefactor."</p>

<p>And these words were really pronounced in entire
sincerity of meaning; not that compunction for his
many crimes touched the brigand's stony heart, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
contrasted the happy peacefulness of the lives of these
labourers to his own wretched, stormy existence; and
still further did he envy them when he reflected upon
all that the Chouette might have in store for him; he
shuddered as he reflected upon the future she would
provide for him, and more than ever regretted, by having
recalled his old accomplice, having for ever lost the
means of dwelling with good and honest persons, such
as those with whom the Chourineur had placed him.
Father Châtelain surveyed the Schoolmaster with an air
of surprise.</p>

<p>"My good man," said he, "I did not know you were
so utterly destitute."</p>

<p>"Alas! yes, it is even so. I lost my sight by an
accident while working at my trade. I am going to
Louvres to endeavour to find a distant relation there,
who, I hope, may be willing to assist me. But, you are
aware, people are not always so open-hearted as they
should be; they do not like distressed objects, such as
myself, coming to claim kindred, and are frequently harsh
and unkind," answered the Schoolmaster, sighing deeply.</p>

<p>"But the most selfish heart would grieve at your
distress," replied the old labourer. "The most hard-hearted
relative would pity a man like you&mdash;a good
and honest workman overtaken by a sudden calamity,
and left without hope or help. Then the moving spectacle
of this young and tender child, your only friend and
guide, would wring pity from the very stones. But how
is it that the master for whom you worked previously to
your accident has done nothing for you?"</p>

<p>"He is now dead," said the Schoolmaster, after a
short hesitation; "and he was my only friend on
earth."</p>

<p>"But then there is the hospital for the blind."</p>

<p>"I am not the right age to qualify me for admission."</p>

<p>"Poor man! yours is, indeed, a hard case."</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely that, in the event of my relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
at Louvres refusing to assist me, your master, whom
I already respect without knowing, would take pity on
me?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, you see, the farm is not a hospital.
Our general rule is to grant all infirm or afflicted travellers
a temporary shelter of a night or a day in the house.
Then some assistance is furnished, and they are put on
their road with a prayer to kind Providence to take
them under its charge."</p>

<p>"Then you think there is no hope of interesting your
master in my unhappy fate?" asked the brigand, with a
sigh of regret.</p>

<p>"I tell you what is the general custom here, my good
man; but so compassionate a person as our master might
go any lengths to serve you."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" said the Schoolmaster.
"Oh, if he would but permit me to remain here, I could
live in any retired corner, and be happy and grateful
for such a mere trifle of subsistence!"</p>

<p>"As I said before, our master is capable of the most
generous actions. But, were he to consent to your
remaining at the farm, there would be no occasion for
you to hide yourself; you would fare in every respect as
you have seen us treated to-day. Some occupation
would be found for your son suitable to his age and
strength. He would not want for good instruction or
wise counsels; our venerable minister would teach him
with the other children of the village, and, in the words
of Scripture, he would grow in goodness and in stature
beneath the pious care of our excellent curé. But the
best way for you to manage this will be to lay every
particular of your case and petition before our 'Lady of
Ready Help,' when she comes into the kitchen, as she
is sure to do before you start on your journey to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"What name did you call your lady by?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I meant our mistress, who always goes by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
appellation amongst us. If she interests herself for you,
your suit will be granted; for, in matters of charity, our
master never opposes her smallest wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, then," exclaimed the Schoolmaster, in a joyous
tone, already exulting in his hoped-for deliverance from
the power of the Chouette, "I will thankfully follow
your advice, and speak to her whenever I have the
blessed opportunity!"</p>

<p>This hope found no echo in the mind of Tortillard,
who felt not the slightest disposition to avail himself of
the offers of the old labourer, and grow up in goodness
under the auspices of the venerable curé. The inclinations
of Bras Rouge's son were anything but rural,
neither did his turn of mind incline to the pastoral.
Faithful to the code of morality professed by the
Chouette, and promulgated by her, he would have been
severely distressed to see the Schoolmaster emancipate
himself from their united tyranny; and he now thought
it high time to recall the brigand from the illusory
visions of flowery meads and all the <i>et c&oelig;teras</i> of a
country life, in which his fancy seemed revelling, to the
realities of his present position.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes," repeated the Schoolmaster; "I will
assuredly address my prayers to your 'Lady of Ready
Help.' She will pity me and kindly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tortillard here interrupted him by a vigorous and
artfully managed kick, so well directed, that, as before,
it took the direst effect on the most sensitive spot. The
intense agony for a time quite bereft the brigand of
speech or breath; but remembering the fatal consequences
of giving way to the feelings which boiled
within him, he struggled for self-command, and, after
a pause of a few minutes, added, in a faint and suffering
voice, "Yes, I venture to hope your good mistress would
pity and befriend me."</p>

<p>"Dear father," said Tortillard, in a hypocritical tone,
"you forget my poor dear aunt, Madame la Chouette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
who is so fond of you. Poor Aunty Chouette, she
would never part with you so easily, I know. Directly
she heard of your staying here, she would come along
with M. Barbillon and fetch you away&mdash;that she would,
I know."</p>

<p>"Madame la Chouette and M. Barbillon. Why this
honest man seems to have relations among all the 'birds
of the air and fishes of the sea,'" uttered Jean René in
a voice of mirthful irony, giving his neighbour rather a
vigorous poke with his elbow. "Funny, isn't it,
Claudine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you great unfeeling calf! How can you make a
joke on these poor creatures?" replied the tender-hearted
dairy-maid, returning Jean René's thrust with sufficient
interest to compromise the safety of his ribs.</p>

<p>"Is Madame la Chouette a relation of yours?" inquired
the old labourer of the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Yes, a distant one," answered the other, with a dull,
dejected manner.</p>

<p>"And is she the person you were going to Louvres to
try and find?" asked Father Châtelain.</p>

<p>"She is," replied the blind man; "but I think my son
overrates her zeal on my account. However, under any
circumstances, I shall speak to your excellent lady to-morrow,
and entreat her aid to further my request with
the kind, charitable owner of this farm, but," added he,
purposely to divert the conversation into another channel,
and so put an end to the imprudent remarks of
Tortillard, "talking of farms, you promised to explain
to me the difference that exists in the management of
this farm and farms in general."</p>

<p>"I did so," replied Father Châtelain, "and I will keep
my word. Now, after having planned all I told you
about the charity of labour, our master said to himself,
'There are many institutions where plans are devised,
and rewards assigned, for improvements in the breed of
horses, cattle, sheep, and other animals for the best constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
ploughs, and other agricultural implements.
And I cannot help thinking that all this time we are
not going to the fountain-head, and beginning, as we
ought to begin, by improving the condition of the labouring
classes themselves, before we give all this heed to the
beast which perisheth. Good beasts are capital things,
but good men are better, and more difficult to meet with.
Give your horses and cattle plenty of good food, clear
running water; place them either out-of-doors in a fine,
healthy atmosphere, or give them a clean, well-managed
stable, with good and regular attendance, and they will
thrive to your heart's content, and be capable of reaching
any degree of excellence. But with men, look you, it is
quite another thing. You cannot elevate a man's mind
as you can fatten an ox. The animal fattens on his
pasture because its taste gratifies his palate; he eats
because he likes what he feeds on, and his body profits
and thrives in proportion to the pleasure with which he
has devoured his food. Well, then, my opinion is, that
to make good advice really profitable to men, they should
be enabled clearly to perceive their own personal advantage
in following it.'"</p>

<p>"Just as the ox is profited by eating the fine grass
that grows around him, Father Châtelain?" said several
voices.</p>

<p>"Precisely the same."</p>

<p>"But, Father Châtelain," exclaimed another voice.
"I have heard talk of a sort of farm where young
thieves, who might in other respects have conducted
themselves very well, are taken in, taught all sorts of
farming knowledge, and fed and treated like princes."</p>

<p>"You have heard quite right, my good fellow, there
is such an institution, and, as far as it goes, is founded
on pure and just motives, and is calculated to do much
good. We should never despair for the wicked, but we
should also hope all things for the good. Suppose now
a strong, healthy, and industrious young man, of excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
character, ready and willing to work, but desirous
of receiving good instruction in his way of life, were to
present himself at the place you are speaking of&mdash;this
farm of reclaimed thieves&mdash;well, the first question
would be, 'Well, my chap, are you a rogue and a vagabond?'
'No!' 'Oh, then we can't receive you here&mdash;we've
no room for honest lads.'"</p>

<p>"What you say, father, is right, every word of it,"
rejoined Jean René. "Rascals are provided for, while
honest men want; and beasts are considered, and their
condition continually improved, while men are passed
over and left in ignorance and neglect."</p>

<p>"It was purposely to remedy what you complain of,
my brave lad, that our master took this farm (as I was
mentioning to our blind visitor). 'I know very well,'
said he, 'that honest men will be rewarded on high, but
then, you see, it is far and long to look forward to, and
there are many (and much to be pitied are they) who
can neither look to such a distance, nor wait with
patience the indefinite period which bids them live on
hope alone. Then how are these poor, depressed, and
toil-worn creatures to find leisure thus to seek religious
comfort? Rising at the first dawn of day, they toil and
labour with weary limbs, till night releases them and
sends them to their wretched hovels. Sunday is spent
by them at the public-house, drinking to drive away the
recollections both of their past and future wretchedness.
Neither can these poor beings turn their very hardships
to a good account by extracting a useful moral from
them. After a hard day's work does their bread seem
less coarse and black, their pallet less hard, their infants
less sickly and meagre, their wives less worn down by
giving nourishment to the feeble babes of their breast?
No, no, far from it. Alas, the thin, half-starved mother
is but ill calculated to nourish another, when she is
obliged to yield her slender share of the family meal to
still the clamours of her famishing children. Yet all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
this might be endured, aye, even cheerfully, for use has
familiarised them with hardships and privations; their
bread is food, though coarse and homely, their straw bed
rests their weary limbs, and their children, though
stunted and sickly, live on. All these, I say, could be
borne, did no comparison arise between their own poverty
and the condition of others; but, when they visit the
town or city on market-days, they see an abundance of
good white loaves crowding the windows of the bakers'
shops; warm, soft mattresses and blankets are displayed
for sale to such as have the means of purchasing; children
fresh and blooming as the flowers of May are playing
joyously about, and even from the superabundance
of their meals casting a portion to the dogs and other
pet animals. Ah! human courage gives way at this
reverse in the picture of human condition; and when
the tired, care-worn men return to their mud hovels,
their black bread and straw pallet, and are surrounded
by a number of squalid, half-starved, wailing infants, to
whom they would gladly have brought the share of cakes
and buns thrown by the pampered children of great
towns in the streets, or cast to the animals, then bitter
discontent and repining take possession of their mind,
and, utterly forgetting that on high is One who careth
for all, they say, "Why is this difference allowed? and, if
there must be both rich and poor in the world, why were
not we born to riches? why should not every man have
his turn in worldly prosperity? We are not justly used
or fairly treated in being always poor and hard worked."
Of course, all this is both sinful and unreasonable; neither
does it in any manner serve to lighten their load; and
yet they must go on, bending, staggering under the
burden too heavy for them to bear, till they sink, utterly
exhausted and worn out. They must toil, toil on, without
hope, without relaxing their daily efforts, or without
once daring to entertain the idea that, by a long continuance
in honest, virtuous, industrious conduct, the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
might come when, like the great Creator of all, they
might rest from their labours, and behold peaceful ease
succeeding the hard-griping hand of poverty. Think of
a whole life passed thus, in one continued struggle for
the bare means of life, without a glimmer of hope to
cheer the thorny path. What must such a life be like?
Why, it would resemble one long rainy day, without a
single ray of brightness from the blessed sun to help us
through it. Then labour is resumed with an unwilling
and dissatisfied spirit. "What does it signify to us," cry
the worn-out labourers, "whether the harvest yields ill or
well? Whether the ears of corn be heavy or light makes
no difference to us. Why should we overwork ourselves,
or trouble our heads with matters that only concern
our master? It is sufficient for us to act with strict
honesty. We will not commit any crime, because there
are laws ready to punish such as do; but neither will we
try to perform acts of goodness, because for those the
laws provide no recompense." Such a mode of arguing,
my boys, is as unwise as it is wrong and sinful, but,
depend upon it, it is true to nature. From this indifference
comes idleness, and from idleness to crime the distance
is very short. Now, unfortunately, among the
class I have been describing, the far greater proportion
consists of those whose conduct may be considered as
neither good nor bad, that is to say, without any particular
leaning either way, and, consequently, a mere trifle
might firmly enlist them in the service of virtue or vice.
These are the very individuals,' continued our master,
'we ought to try and improve, just as we should have
done had they been born to the honour of figuring as
animals with hoofs, horns, or woolly coats. Let us continue
to point out to them how completely it is to their
interest to be active, industrious, steady, and well qualified
to discharge their several duties; let us effectually
convince them that, by becoming better men, they will
also be much happier; let them see how closely their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
good behaviour and prosperity are interwoven, and, that
good advice may sink the deeper into their hearts, give
them, as it were, such a taste of earthly comfort as shall,
in a slight degree, communicate to them the hope and
notion of expecting the unspeakable reward prepared by
the Great Giver of all, whose dwelling is on high.'</p>

<p>"Having well arranged his plans, our master caused
it to be made known in the environs that he wished to
engage twelve farm servants, six men and six females;
but that his choice would be entirely regulated by the
most satisfactory certificates of good conduct obtained
from the civil and religious authorities in their native
place. They were to be paid like princes, fed upon the
best food to their hearts' content; and further, a tenth
part of the produce of the harvest was to be shared
among the labourers. The engagement at the farm was
to last but two years, at the end of which time they were
to give place to other labourers, chosen upon the same
terms; but, at the expiration of five years, the original
labourers were taken on again, in the event of there
being any vacancies; so that, since the establishment of
this farm, it is usual for the labourers and working classes
in the neighbourhood to say, 'Let us be active, honest, and
industrious, so as to obtain a high character for such
good qualities, and, perhaps, one day we may be fortunate
to get engaged at Bouqueval Farm. There, for a
couple of years, we shall lead a life of perfect happiness.
We shall learn our business thoroughly; we shall save
a little money, so that, when our time is up, every one
will be glad to engage us, because they know that we
must have had first-rate characters to have been admitted
on the establishment at all.'"</p>

<p>"I am already bespoke by M. Dubreuil for his farm at
Arnouville," said Jean René.</p>

<p>"And I am engaged to a first-rate service at Gonesse,"
chimed in another labourer.</p>

<p>"You see, my good friend, by this plan everybody is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
a gainer, the neighbouring farmers particularly. There
are but twelve places for servants on the farm, but there
are, perhaps, fifty candidates who have all earned their
right to solicit an engagement by certificates and testimonials
of excellent conduct. Well, though thirty-eight
out of the fifty must be disappointed, yet the good which
is in them will still remain; and there are so many
good and deserving characters in the environs we can
safely reckon upon; for, though they have failed in this
application, they still live in hopes of succeeding another
time. Why, for every prize animal to which the medal
is assigned, whether for swiftness, strength, or beauty,
there must be a hundred or more trained to stand
forward and dispute the choice; and those animals rejected
do not lose any of those qualifications because
they were not accepted; far from it; their value is
acknowledged, and they quickly find persons desirous
of possessing them. Now, friend," said Father Châtelain,
having fairly talked himself out of breath, "do you
not confess that I was right when I said ours was no
common farm, any more than our employer was no
ordinary master?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Schoolmaster, "your account is
most interesting, and fully bears out all you asserted.
But, the more I hear of the exalted views and noble
generosity of your master, the more earnestly do I pray
he may be induced to look with pity on my wretched
condition. To such a man, so filled with a desire to
improve the condition of God's creatures, a charitable
action more or less would make but little difference.
Oh, tell me beforehand his name, and that of your kind
Lady of the Ready Help, that I may already bless and
thank them; for full certain am I, minds so bent upon
good deeds will never turn a deaf ear to my petition."</p>

<p>"Now I dare say you expect to be told the high-sounding
titles of some great, grand personages. But,
bless you! no such thing; no more parade about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
names than those of the saints themselves. 'Our Lady
of Help' is called Madame Georges, and our good master
plain M. Rodolph."</p>

<p>"Merciful powers! My wife! my judge! my executioner!"
faintly exclaimed the robber, struck almost
speechless at this unexpected revelation. "Rodolph!&mdash;Madame
Georges!"</p>

<p>It was wholly impossible for the Schoolmaster to
entertain a doubt respecting the identity of the persons
to whom those names belonged. Previously to adjudging
him his fearful punishment, Rodolph had spoken of
the lively interest he took in all that concerned Madame
Georges. The recent visit of the negro David to this
farm was another conclusive proof of there being no
mistake in the matter. It seemed as though the very
hand of Providence had brought about this singular
rencontre, overthrowing as it so completely did his recently
cherished hopes of emancipation from his present
misery, through the intervention of the generosity of the
proprietor of this farm. To fly was his first impulse.
The very name of Rodolph inspired him with the most
intense terror. Possibly he was even now in the house.
Scarcely recovered from his first alarm, the brigand rose
from the table, and, grasping the hand of Tortillard,
exclaimed, in a wild and terrified manner:</p>

<p>"Let us be gone!&mdash;quick!&mdash;lead me hence. Let us
go, I say."</p>

<p>The whole of the servants looked on with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Father Châtelain, with much surprise.
"Why? Wherefore should you go? What are you
thinking about, my friend? Come, what fresh whim
is this? Are you quite in your right senses?"</p>

<p>Tortillard cleverly availed himself of this last suggestion,
and, uttering a deep sigh, touched his forehead
significantly with his forefinger, so as to convey to the
minds of the wondering labourers the impression that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
his pretended parent was not quite right in his head.
The signal elicited a corresponding gesture of pity and
due comprehension.</p>

<p>"Come, I say, come!" persisted the Schoolmaster,
endeavouring to draw the boy along with him; but, fully
determined not to quit such comfortable quarters to
wander about in the fields all night during the frost and
snow, Tortillard began in a whimpering voice to say:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! poor father has got one of his
old fits come on again. There, there, father, sit down
and keep yourself quiet. Pray do, and don't think of
wandering out in the cold&mdash;it would kill you, maybe.
No, not if you are ever so angry with me, will I be so
wicked as to lead you out in such weather." Then, addressing
himself to the labourers, he said, "Will none
of you good gentlemen help me to keep my poor dear
father from risking his life by going out to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my boy," answered Father Châtelain;
"make yourself perfectly easy. We will not allow your
father to quit the place. He shall stay here to-night, in
spite of himself."</p>

<p>"Surely you will not keep me here against my will?"
inquired the wretched Schoolmaster, in hurried accents;
"and perhaps, too, I should offend your master by my
presence&mdash;that Monsieur Rodolph. You told me the
farm was not an hospital; once more, therefore, I ask
you to let me go forth in peace on my way."</p>

<p>"Offend our master!&mdash;that you would not, I am quite
sure. But make yourself easy on that score. I am sorry
to say that he does not live here, neither do we see him
half as frequently as we could wish. But, if even he
had been here, your presence would have made no sort
of difference to him."</p>

<p>"No, no," persisted the blind man with continued
alarm; "I have changed my mind about applying to
him. My son is right. No doubt my relation at Louvres
will take care of me. I will go there at once."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"All I have got to say," replied Father Châtelain,
kindly conceiving that he was speaking to a man whose
brain was unhappily affected, "is just this&mdash;that to attempt
to proceed on your journey with this poor child
to-night is wholly out of the question. Come, let me
put matters to rights for you, and say no more about it."</p>

<p>Although now being reassured of Rodolph's not being
at Bouqueval, the terrors of the Schoolmaster were by no
means dissipated; and, spite of his frightfully disfigured
countenance, he was in momentary dread of being recognized
by his wife, who might at any moment enter the
kitchen, when he was perfectly persuaded she would instantly
denounce and give him into custody; his firm
impression having been, from the hour of receiving his
horrible punishment from the hands of Rodolph, that it
was done to satisfy the hatred and vengeance of Madame
Georges. But, unable to quit the farm, the ruffian
found himself wholly at the mercy of Tortillard. Resigning
himself, therefore, to what was unavoidable, yet
anxious to escape from the eyes of his wife, he said to
the venerable labourer:</p>

<p>"Since you kindly assure me my being here will in no
way displease either your master or mistress, I will gladly
accept your hospitality; but, as I am much fatigued, and
must set out again at break of day, I would humbly ask
permission to go at once to my bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to-morrow morning by all means, and as
soon as you like; we are very early people here. And,
for fear even that you should again wander from the
right road, some one shall conduct you part of the way."</p>

<p>"If you have no objection," said Jean René, addressing
Father Châtelain, "I will see the poor man a good
step on the road; because Madame Georges said yesterday
I was to take the chaise and go to the lawyer's at
Villiers le Bel to fetch a large sum of money she requires
of him."</p>

<p>"Go with the poor blind traveller by all means," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Father Châtelain; "but you must walk, mind.
Madame has changed her mind about sending to Villiers
del Bel, and, wisely reflecting that it was not worth
while to have so large a sum of money lying useless at
the farm, has determined to let it remain with the lawyer
till Monday next, which will be the day she requires it."</p>

<p>"Of course, Father Châtelain; mistress knows best.
But please to tell me why she should consider it unsafe
to have money at the farm. What is she afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Of nothing, my lad. Thank God, there is no occasion
for fear. But, for all that, I would much rather
have five hundred sacks of corn on the premises than ten
bags of crowns. Come," said old Châtelain, addressing
himself to the brigand and Tortillard, "come, follow me,
friend; and you too, my lad." Then, taking up a small
lamp, he conducted his two guests to a chamber on the
ground floor, first traversing a large passage into which
several doors opened. Placing the light on a table, the
old labourer said to the Schoolmaster, "Here is your
lodging, and may God grant you a good and peaceful
night's repose, my good friend. As for you, my little
man, you are sure to sleep sound and well; it belongs to
your happy age to do so."</p>

<p>The Schoolmaster, pensive and meditative, sat down
by the side of the bed to which Tortillard conducted
him. At the instant when Father Châtelain was quitting
the room, Tortillard made him a sign indicative of
his desire to speak with him alone, and hastily rejoined
him in the passage.</p>

<p>"What is it, my boy, you have to say to me?"
inquired the old man, kindly.</p>

<p>"Ah, my kind sir, I only wanted to say that my
father is frequently seized during the night with most
violent convulsion-fits, which require a much stronger
person than I am to hold him; should I be obliged to
call for help, is there any person near who could hear
me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the labourer, sympathisingly;
"make yourself easy. There,&mdash;do you see that door
beside the staircase?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, good, kind gentleman; I see it."</p>

<p>"Well, one of the farm labourers sleeps in that room.
You will only just have to run to him. He never locks
his door; and he will come to your father in an
instant."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; God bless you! I will remember
all your kindness when I say my prayers. But suppose,
sir, the man and myself were not strong enough together
to manage my poor father when these violent
convulsions come on, could you, who look so good, and
speak so kind&mdash;could you be kind enough to come and
tell us what to do?"</p>

<p>"Me, my boy? Oh, I sleep, as well as all the other
men servants, out of the house, in a large outbuilding in
the courtyard. But make yourself quite comfortable.
Jean René could manage a mad bull, he is so powerful.
Besides, if you really wished any further help he would
go and call up our old cook; she sleeps on the first
floor, even with our mistress and young mademoiselle,
and I can promise you that our old woman is a most
excellent sick-nurse should your father require any one
to attend to him when the fit is over."</p>

<p>"Thank you, kind gentleman, a thousand times.
Good-night, sir. I will go now and pray of God to
bless you for your kindness and pity to the poor
blind."</p>

<p>"Good night, my lad! Let us hope both you and
your father will enjoy a sound night's rest, and have no
occasion to require any person's help. You had better
return to your room now; your poor father may be
wanting you."</p>

<p>"I will, sir. Good night, and thank you!"</p>

<p>"God preserve you both, my child!" And the old
man returned to the kitchen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had he turned his back than the limping
rascal made one of those supremely insulting and derisive
gestures familiar to all the blackguards of Paris,
consisting in slapping the nape of the neck repeatedly
with the left hand, darting the right hand quite open
continually out in a straight line. With the most consummate
audacity, this dangerous child had just gleaned,
under the mask of guileless tenderness and apprehension
for his father, information most important for the
furtherance of the schemes of the Chouette and Schoolmaster.
He had ascertained during the last few minutes
that the part of the building where he slept was only
occupied by Madame Georges, Fleur-de-Marie, an old
female servant, and one of the farm-labourers. Upon
his return to the room he was to share with the blind
man, Tortillard carefully avoided approaching him.
The former, however, heard his step, and growled
out:</p>

<p>"Where have you been, you vagabond?"</p>

<p>"What! you want to know, do you, old blind 'un?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make you pay for all you have made me
suffer this evening, you wretched urchin!" exclaimed
the Schoolmaster, rising furiously, and groping about in
every direction after Tortillard, feeling by the walls as a
guide. "I'll strangle you when I catch you, you young
fiend&mdash;you infernal viper!"</p>

<p>"Poor, dear father! How prettily he plays at blind-man's
buff with his own little boy," said Tortillard,
grinning, and enjoying the ease with which he escaped
from the impotent attempts of the Schoolmaster to seize
him, who, though impelled to the exertion by his overboiling
rage, was soon compelled to cease, and, as had
been the case before, to give up all hopes of inflicting
the revenge he yearned to bestow on the impish son of
Bras Rouge.</p>

<p>Thus compelled to submit to the impudent persecution
of his juvenile tormentor, and await the propitious hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
when all his injuries could safely be avenged, the brigand
determined to reserve his powerless wrath for a fitting
opportunity of paying off old scores, and, worn out in
body by his futile violence, threw himself, swearing and
cursing, on the bed.</p>

<p>"Dear father!&mdash;sweet father!&mdash;have you got the
toothache that you swear so? Ah, if Monsieur le Curé
heard you, what would he say to you? He would give
you such penance! Oh, my!"</p>

<p>"That's right!&mdash;go on!" replied the ruffian, in a
hollow and suppressed voice, after long enduring this
entertaining vivacity on the part of the young gentleman.
"Laugh at me!&mdash;mock me!&mdash;make sport of my
calamity, cowardly scoundrel that you are! That is a
fine, noble action, is it not? Just worthy of such a
mean, ignoble, contemptible soul as dwells within that
wretched, crooked body!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how fine we talk! How nice we preach about
being generous, and all that, don't we?" cried Tortillard,
bursting into peals of laughter. "I beg your pardon,
dear father, but I can't possibly help thinking it so funny
to hear you, whose fingers were regular fish-hooks, picking
and stealing whatever came in their way; and, as
for generosity, I beg you don't mention it, because, till
you got your eyes poked out I don't suppose you ever
thought of such a word!"</p>

<p>"But, at least, I never did you any harm. Why, then,
torment me thus?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the first place, you said what I did not
like to the Chouette; then you had a fancy for stopping
and playing the fool among the clodhoppers here. Perhaps
you mean to commence a course of asses' milk?"</p>

<p>"You impudent young beggar! If I had only had the
opportunity of remaining at this farm&mdash;which I now
wish sunk in the bottomless pit, or blasted with eternal
lightning&mdash;you should not have played your tricks of
devilish cruelty with me any longer!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"You to remain here! that would be a farce! Who,
then, would Madame la Chouette have for her <i>bête de
souffrance?</i> Me, perhaps, thank ye!&mdash;don't you wish
you may get it?"</p>

<p>"Miserable abortion!"</p>

<p>"Abortion! ah, yes, another reason why I say, as
well as Aunt Chouette, there is nothing so funny as to
see you in one of your unaccountable passions&mdash;you,
who could kill me with one blow of your fist; it's more
funny than if you were a poor, weak creature. How
very funny you were at supper to-night! <i>Dieu de Dieu!</i>
what a lark I had all to myself! Why, it was better
than a play at the Gaîté. At every kick I gave you on
the sly, your passion made all the blood fly in your face,
and your white eyes became red all round; they only
wanted a bit of blue in the middle to have been real tri-coloured.
They would have made two fine cockades for
the town-sergeant, wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, you like to laugh&mdash;you are merry:
bah! it's natural at your age&mdash;it's natural&mdash;I'm not
angry with you," said the Schoolmaster, in an air of
affected carelessness, hoping to propitiate Tortillard;
"but, instead of standing there, saying saucy things, it
would be much better for you to remember what the
Chouette told you; you say you are very fond of her.
You should examine all over the place, and get the print
of the locks. Didn't you hear them say they expected
to have a large sum of money here on Monday? We will
be amongst them then, and have our share. I should
have been foolish to have stayed here; I should have
had enough of these asses of country people at the end
of a week, shouldn't I, boy?" asked the ruffian, to flatter
Tortillard.</p>

<p>"If you had stayed here I should have been very
much annoyed, 'pon my word and honour," replied Bras
Rouge's son, in a mocking tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, there's a good business to be done in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
house; and, if there should be nothing to steal, yet I
will return here with the Chouette, if only to have my
revenge," said the miscreant, in a tone full of fury and
malice, "for now I am sure it is my wife who excited
that infernal Rodolph against me; he who, in blinding
me, has put me at the mercy of all the world, of the
Chouette, and a young blackguard like yourself. Well,
if I cannot avenge myself on him, I will have vengeance
against my wife,&mdash;yes, she shall pay me for all, even if
I set fire to this accursed house and bury myself in its
smouldering ruins. Yes, I will&mdash;I will have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will, you want to get hold of your wife, eh, old
gentleman? She is within ten paces of you! that's vexing,
ain't it? If I liked, I could lead you to the door of
her room, that's what I could, for I know the room. I
know it&mdash;I know it&mdash;I know it," added Tortillard,
singing according to his custom.</p>

<p>"You know her room?" said the Schoolmaster, in an
agony of fervent joy; "you know it?"</p>

<p>"I see you coming," said Tortillard; "come, play the
pretty, and get on your hind legs like a dog when they
throw him a dainty bone. Now, old Cupid!"</p>

<p>"You know my wife's chamber?" said the miscreant,
turning to the side whence the sound of Tortillard's
voice proceeded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it; and, what's still better, only one of
the farm servants sleeps on the side of the house where
we are. I know his door&mdash;the key is in it&mdash;click,
one turn, and he's all safe and fast. Come, get up, old
blind Cupid!"</p>

<p>"Who told you all this?" asked the blind scoundrel,
rising involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Capital, Cupid! By the side of your wife's room
sleeps an old cook&mdash;one more turn of the key, and
click! we are masters of the house&mdash;masters of your
wife, and the young girl with the gray mantle that you
must catch hold of and carry off. Now, then, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
paw, old Cupid; do the pretty to your master directly."</p>

<p>"You lie! you lie! how could you know all this?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm lame in my leg, but not in my head.
Before we left the kitchen I said to the old guzzling
labourer that sometimes in the night you had convulsions,
and I asked him where I could get assistance if
you were attacked. He said if you were attacked I
might call up the man servant and the cook; and he
showed me where they slept; one down, the other up
stairs in the first floor, close to your wife&mdash;your wife&mdash;your
wife!"</p>

<p>And Tortillard repeated his monotonous song. After
a lengthened silence the Schoolmaster said to him, in a
calm voice, but with an air of desperate determination:</p>

<p>"Listen, boy. I have stayed long enough. Lately&mdash;yes,
yes, I confess it&mdash;I had a hope which now makes
my lot appear still more frightful; the prison, the <i>bagne</i>,
the guillotine, are nothing&mdash;nothing to what I have
endured since this morning; and I shall have the same
to endure always. Lead me to my wife's room; I have
my knife here; I will kill her. I shall be killed afterwards;
but what of that? My hatred swells till it
chokes me; I shall have revenge, and that will console
me. What I now suffer is too much&mdash;too much! for
me, too, before whom everybody trembled. Now, lad,
if you knew what I endure, even you would pity me.
Even now my brain appears ready to burst; my pulse
beats as if my veins would burst; my head whirls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cold in your 'knowledge-box,' old chap&mdash;that's it;
sneeze&mdash;that'll cure you," said Tortillard, with a loud
grin; "what say you to a pinch of snuff, old brick?"</p>

<p>And striking loudly on the back of his left hand,
which was clenched, as if he were tapping on the lid of
a snuff-box, he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"J'ai du bon tabac dans ma tabatière;</span><br />
<span class="i0h">J'ai du bon tabac, tu n'en auras pas."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</i> they will drive me
mad!" cried the brigand, becoming really almost
demented by a sort of nervous excitement arising
from bloodthirsty revenge and implacable hatred, which
in vain sought to satiate itself. The exuberant strength
of this monster could only be equalled by the impossibility
of satisfying his deadly desires. Let us imagine a
hungry, furious, maddened wolf, teased during a whole
day by a child through the bars of his den, and scenting
within two paces of him a victim who would at once
satisfy his hunger and his rage. At the last taunt of
Tortillard the brigand almost lost his senses; unable to
reach his victim, he desired in his frenzy to shed his
own blood, for his blood was stifling him. One moment
he resolved to kill himself, and, had he had a loaded
pistol in his hand, he would not have hesitated; he
fumbled in his pocket, and drew out a clasp-knife,
opened it, and raised it to strike; but, quick as were his
movements, reflection, fear, and vital instinct were still
more rapid,&mdash;the murderer lacked courage,&mdash;his arm
fell on his knees. Tortillard had watched all his actions
with an attentive eye, and, when he saw the finale of
this pseudo-tragedy, he continued, mockingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How, boys, a duel? Ah, pluck the chickens!"</p>

<p>The Schoolmaster, fearing that he should lose his
senses if he gave way to an ineffectual burst of fury,
turned a deaf ear to this fresh insult of Tortillard,
who so impertinently commented on the cowardice of
an assassin who recoiled from suicide. Despairing
of escape from what he termed, by a sort of avenging
fatality, the cruelty of his cursed child, the ruffian
sought to try what could be done by assailing the
avarice of the son of Bras Rouge.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he to him, in a tone almost supplicatory,
"lead me to the door of my wife's room, and take anything
you like that's in her room and run away with it!
leave me to myself. You may cry out 'murder' if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
like; they will apprehend me&mdash;kill me on the spot&mdash;I
care not, I shall die avenged, if I have not the courage
to end my existence myself. Oh, lead me there&mdash;lead
me there; depend on it she has gold, jewels, anything,
and you may take all, all for yourself, for your own, do
you mind?&mdash;your own; only lead me to the door where
she is."</p>

<p>"Yes, I mind well enough; you want me to lead you
to her door, then to her bed, and then to tell you when
to strike, then to guide your hand&mdash;eh! that's it, ain't
it? You want to make me a handle to your knife, old
monster!" replied Tortillard, with an expression of contempt,
anger, and horror, which, for the first time in his
life gave an appearance of seriousness to his weasel face,
usually all impertinence and insolence; "I'll be killed
first, I tell you, sooner than I'll lead you to where your
wife is!"</p>

<p>"You refuse?"</p>

<p>The son of Bras Rouge made no reply. He approached
with bare feet and without being heard by the Schoolmaster,
who, seated on the bed, still held his large knife
in his hand, and then, in a moment, with marvellous
quickness and dexterity, Tortillard snatched from him
his weapon, and with one jump skipped to the further
end of the chamber.</p>

<p>"My knife! my knife!" cried the brigand, extending
his arms.</p>

<p>"No; for then you might to-morrow morning ask to
speak with your wife and try to kill her, since, as you
say, you have had enough of life, and are such a coward
that you don't dare kill yourself."</p>

<p>"How he defends my wife against me!" said the
bandit, whose intellect became obscure. "This little
wretch is a devil! Where am I? Why does he try to
save her?"</p>

<p>"Because I like it," said Tortillard, whose face
resumed its usual appearance of sly impudence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, is that it?" murmured the Schoolmaster, whose
mind was wandering; "well, then, I'll fire the house!
we'll all burn&mdash;all! I prefer that furnace to the other.
The candle! the candle!"</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! ah!" exclaimed Tortillard, bursting out
again into loud laughter. "If your own candle&mdash;your
'peepers'&mdash;had not been snuffed out, and for ever, you
would have known that ours had been extinguished
an hour ago." And Tortillard sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ma chandelle est morte,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Je n'ai plus de feu."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The Schoolmaster gave a deep groan, stretched out
his arms, and fell heavily on the floor, his face on the
ground, and, struck by a rush of blood, remained motionless.</p>

<p>"Not to be caught, old boy," said Tortillard; "that's
only a trick to make me come to you that you may
serve me out! When you have been long enough on
the floor you'll get up."</p>

<p>Bras Rouge's boy resolved not to go to sleep for fear
of being surprised by the Schoolmaster, so seated himself
in a chair, with his eyes fixed on the ruffian, persuaded
that it was a trap laid for him, and not believing
the Schoolmaster in any danger. That he might employ
himself agreeably Tortillard drew silently and
carefully from his pocket a little red silk purse, and
counted slowly, and with looks of joy and avarice, the
seventeen pieces of gold which it contained. Tortillard
had acquired his ill-gotten riches thus: It may be remembered
that Madame d'Harville was nearly surprised
by her husband at the rendezvous which she had granted
to the commandant. Rodolph, when he had given the
purse to the young lady had told her to go up to the
fifth story to the Morels, under the pretence of bringing
them assistance. Madame d'Harville ran quickly up the
staircase holding the purse in her hands. When Tortillard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
who was coming from the quack's, caught a glimpse
of the purse, and, pretending to stumble as he passed the
marquise, pushed against her, and, in the shock, slily
stole the purse. Madame d'Harville, bewildered, and
hearing her husband's footsteps, hurried on to the fifth
story without thinking or complaining of the impudent
robbery of the little cripple. After having counted and
recounted his gold Tortillard cast his eyes towards the
Schoolmaster who was extended still on the ground.
Disquieted for a moment, he listened, and hearing the
robber breathe freely he thought that he was still meditating
some trick against him.</p>

<p>Chance saved the Schoolmaster from a congestion of
the brain which else must have proved mortal. His
fall had caused a salutary and abundant bleeding at
the nose. He then fell into kind of a feverish torpor&mdash;half
sleep, half delirium, and then had this wild, this
fearful dream!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>THE DREAM.</h5>


<p>This was the Schoolmaster's dream:</p>

<p>He was again in Rodolph's house in the Allée des
Veuves. The saloon in which the miscreant had received
his appalling punishment had not undergone any alteration.
Rodolph himself was sitting at the table on which
were the Schoolmaster's papers and the little <i>Saint-Esprit</i>
of <i>lapis</i> which he had given to the Chouette.
Rodolph's countenance was grave and sad. On his right
the negro David was standing motionless and silent; on
his left was the Chourineur, who looked on with a
bewildered mien. In his dream the Schoolmaster was
no longer blind, but saw through a medium of clear
blood, which filled the cavities of his eyeballs. All and
everything seemed to him tinted with red. As birds of
prey hover on motionless wing above the head of the
victim which they fascinate before they devour, so a
monstrous screech-owl (<i>chouette</i>), having for its head the
hideous visage of the one-eyed hag, soared over the
Schoolmaster, keeping fixed on him her round, glaring,
and green eye. This fixed stare was upon his breast
like a heavy weight. The Schoolmaster discerned a vast
lake of blood separating him from the table at which
Rodolph was seated. Then this inflexible judge, as well
as the Chourineur and the negro, grew and grew, expanding
into colossal proportions, until they touched the
ceiling; and then it also became higher in proportion.
The lake of blood was calm, and as unruffled as a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mirror; the Schoolmaster saw his hideous countenance
reflected therein. Then that was suddenly effaced by
the tumult of the swelling waves. From their troubled
surface there arose a vapour resembling the foul exhalation
of a marsh, a livid-coloured mist of that violet hue
peculiar to the lips of the dead. In proportion as this
miasma rises&mdash;rises, the faces of Rodolph, the Chourineur,
and the negro continue to expand and expand
in an extraordinary manner, and always remain above
this fearful cloud. In the midst of the awful vapour,
the Schoolmaster sees the pale ghosts, and those murderous
scenes in which he had been the actor. In this fantastic
mirage he first sees a little bald-headed old man,
clad in a long brown coat, and wearing an eye-shade of
green silk. He is employing himself in a dilapidated
chamber in counting and arranging pieces of gold into
piles by the light of a lamp. Through the window,
lighted by the dim moonlight reflected on the tops of
some high trees waving in the wind, the Schoolmaster
recognises his own figure. Pressing his distorted features
against the glass, following every motion of the
old man with glaring eyes, then breaking a pane, he
opens the window itself, leaps with a bound upon his
victim, and stabs him between the shoulders with his
long and keen knife. The movement is so rapid, the
blow so quick and sure, that the dead body of the old
man remains seated in the chair.</p>

<p>The murderer tries to withdraw his weapon from the
dead body,&mdash;he cannot! He redoubles his efforts,&mdash;in
vain! He then seeks to quit the deadly steel,&mdash;impossible!</p>

<p>The hand of the assassin clings to the handle of the
poignard, as the blade of the poignard clings to the frame
of the wounded man. The murderer then hears the
sound of clinking spurs and clashing swords in the
adjoining room. He must escape at all risks, and
attempts to carry with him the body of the feeble old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
man, from which he cannot withdraw either his weapon
or his hand.</p>

<p>He cannot do even this. The light and feeble carcass
weighs him down like a mass of lead. Despite his herculean
shoulders, his desperate efforts, the Schoolmaster
cannot even stir this overwhelming weight.</p>

<p>The sound of echoing steps and jingling sabres comes
nearer and nearer. The key turns in the lock,&mdash;the
door opens. The vision disappears.</p>

<p>And then the screech-owl flaps her wing, and shrieks
out:</p>

<p>"It is the old miser of the Rue de la Roule. Your
maiden murder! murder! murder!"</p>

<p>A moment's darkness,&mdash;then the miasma which
covers the lake of blood resumes its transparency,
and another spectre is revealed.</p>

<p>The day begins to dawn,&mdash;the fog is thick and heavy.
A man, clothed like a cattle-dealer, lies stretched, dead
on the bank of the highroad. The trampled earth, the
torn turf, proved that the victim had made a desperate
resistance. The man has five bleeding wounds in his
breast. He is lifeless; yet still he seems to whistle on
his dogs, calling to them, "Help! help!"</p>

<p>But his whistling, his cries, proceed from five large
and gaping wounds,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Each one a death in nature,"&mdash;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>which move like so many complaining lips. The five
calls, the five whistlings, all made and heard at once,
come from the dead man by the mouths of his gushing
wounds; and fearful are they to hear!</p>

<p>At this instant the Chouette waves her wings, and
mocks the deathly groans of the victim with five bursts
of laughter,&mdash;a laughter as unearthly and as horrible
as the madman's mirth; and then again she shrieks:</p>

<p>"The cattle-dealer of Poissy. Murder! murder!
murder!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Protracted and underground echoes first repeat aloud
the malevolent laughter of the screech-owl. Then they
seem to die away in the very bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>At this sound two large dogs, as black as midnight,
with eyes glaring like burning coals, begin to run rapidly
around&mdash;around&mdash;around the Schoolmaster, baying
furiously. They almost touch him, and yet their bark
appears as distant as if carried on the wind of the
morning.</p>

<p>Gradually these spectres fade away as the previous
one did, and are lost in the pale vapour which is
continually ascending.</p>

<p>A new exhalation now arises from the lake of blood,
and spreads itself on its surface. It is a sort of greenish,
transparent mist; it resembles the vertical section of a
canal filled with water. At first he sees the bed of the
canal covered in by a thick vase formed of numberless
reptiles usually imperceptible to the unassisted eye, but
which, enlarged, as if viewed through a microscope,
assume monstrous forms, vast proportions relatively
to their actual size. It is no longer mud, but a compact,
living, crawling mass,&mdash;an inextricable conglomeration
which wriggles and curls; so close, so dense, that
a sullen and low undulation hardly stirs the level of this
vase, or rather bed of foulest animalculæ. Above trickles
gently&mdash;gently, a turbid stream, thick and stagnating,
which, in its dilatory flow, disturbs the filth incessantly
vomited by the sewers of a great city,&mdash;fragments of
all sorts, carcasses of animals, etc., etc. Suddenly the
Schoolmaster hears the plash of a body, which falls
heavily on the water; in its recoil the water sprinkles
his very face. In the midst of the air-bubbles which
rise thick and fast to the surface of the canal he sees
the body of a woman, which sinks rapidly as she
struggles&mdash;struggles.</p>

<p>Then he sees himself and the Chouette running
hastily along the banks of St. Martin's Canal, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
with them a box covered with black cloth; and yet
he is still present during all the variations of agony
suffered by the victim whom he and the Chouette have
thrown into the canal. After the first immersion the
victim rises to the surface and moves her arms in violent
agitation like some one who, not knowing how to swim,
tries in vain to save herself. Then she utters a piercing
cry,&mdash;a cry of one in the last extremity,&mdash;despairing&mdash;which
ends in the sullen, stifled sound of involuntary
choking; and the woman the second time sinks
beneath the troubled waters.</p>

<p>The screech-owl, which hovers continually motionless,
imitates the convulsive rattle of the drowning wretch, as
she mocked the dying groans of the cattle-dealer. In the
midst of bursts of deathlike laughter the screech-owl
utters, "Glou! glou! glou!"</p>

<p>The subterranean echoes repeated the sound.</p>

<p>A second time submerged the woman is fast suffocating,
and makes one more desperate effort for breath;
but, instead of air, it is water which she inspires. Then
her head falls back, her convulsed features are swollen
and become livid, her neck becomes blue and tumefied,
her arms stiffen, and, in a last spasmodic effort, the
drowning woman in her agony moves her feet, which are
resting on the vase. Then she is surrounded by a mass
of black soil, which ascends with her to the surface of
the water. Scarcely has the choked wretch breathed her
last sigh than she is covered with myriads of the microscopic
reptiles,&mdash;the greedy and horrible vermin of the
mud. The carcass floats for a moment, balances for a
moment, and then sinks slowly, horizontally, the feet
lower than the head, and between the double waters
begins to follow the current of the land. Sometimes
the dead corpse turns, and its pale face is before the
Schoolmaster. Then the spectre fixes on him glaringly
its two blue, glassy, and opaque eyes; the livid mouth
opens. The Schoolmaster is far away from the drowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
woman, and yet her lips murmur in his ears, "Glou!
glou! glou!" accompanying these appalling syllables with
that singular noise which a bottle thrust into the water
makes when filling itself.</p>

<p>The screech-owl repeats, "Glou! glou! glou!" flapping
her wings, and shrieking:</p>

<p>"The woman of the Canal St. Martin! Murder!
murder! murder!"</p>

<p>The vision of the drowned woman disappears. The
lake of blood, through which the Schoolmaster still constantly
beholds Rodolph, becomes of a bronzed, black
colour, then red again, and then changes instantaneously
into a liquid, furnace-like, molten metal. Then that lake
of fire rises&mdash;rises&mdash;rises towards the sky like an
immense whirlpool. There is now a fiery horizon like
iron at a white heat. This immense, boundless horizon
dazzles and scorches the very eyes of the Schoolmaster,
who, fascinated, fastened to the spot, cannot turn away
his gaze. Then, at the bottom of this burning lava,
whose reflection seems to consume him, he sees pass
and repass, one by one, the black and giant spectres of
his victims.</p>

<p>"The magic-lanthorn of remorse! remorse! remorse!"
shrieks the night-bird, flapping her hideous
wings, and laughing mockingly.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the intolerable anguish which his
impatient gaze creates, the Schoolmaster has his eyes
fixed on the grisly phantoms which move in the blazing
sheet. Then an indefinable horror steals over him.
Passing through every step of indescribable torture, by
dint of contemplating this blazing sight, he feels his
eyeballs&mdash;which have replaced the blood with which
his orbits were filled at the commencement of his dream&mdash;he
feels his eyeballs grow hot, burning, and melt in
this furnace&mdash;to smoke and bubble&mdash;and at last to
become calcined in their cavities like two crucibles filled
with red fire. By a fearful power, after having seen as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
well as felt the successive transformations of his eyeballs
into ashes, he falls into the darkness of his actual
blindness.</p>

<p>But now, suddenly, his intolerable agonies are assuaged
as though by enchantment. An odorous air of delicious
freshness passes over his burning eyeballs. This air is
a lovely admixture of the scents of springtime, which
exhale from flowers bathed in evening dew. The
Schoolmaster hears all about him a gentle murmur, like
that of the breeze which just stirs the leaves&mdash;like that
of a brook of running waters, which rushes and murmurs
on its bed of stone and moss "in the leafy month
of June." Thousands of birds warble the most enchanting
melodies. They are stilled, and the voices of children,
of angelic tone, sing strange, unknown words&mdash;words
that are "winged" (if we may use the expression),
and which the Schoolmaster hears mount to
heaven with gentle motion. A feeling of moral health,
of tranquillity, of undefined languor, creeps over him by
degrees. It is an expansion of the heart, an elevation
of the mind, an effort of the soul, of which no physical
feeling, how delicious soever it may be, can impart the
least idea. He feels himself softly soaring in a heavenly
sphere; he seems to rise to an immeasurable height.</p>

<p class="center dots">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>After having for some moments revelled in this unspeakable
felicity he again finds himself in the dark
abyss of his habitual thoughts. His dream continues;
but he is again but the muzzled miscreant who blasphemes
and curses in the paroxysm of his impotent
rage. A voice is heard&mdash;sonorous&mdash;solemn. It is
Rodolph's. The Schoolmaster starts "like a guilty
thing upon a fearful summons." He has the vague consciousness
of a dream; but the alarm with which
Rodolph inspires him is so great that he tries, but
vainly, to escape from this fresh vision. The voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
speaks&mdash;he listens. The tone of Rodolph is not severe;
it is "rather in sorrow than in anger."</p>

<p>"Unhappy man," he says to the Schoolmaster, "the
hour of your repentance has not yet sounded. God only
knows when it will strike. The punishment of your
crimes is still incomplete; you have suffered, but not
expiated. Destiny follows out its work of full justice.
Your accomplices have become your tormentors. A
woman, a child, tame, subdue, conquer you. When I
sentenced you to a terrible punishment for your crimes
I said&mdash;do you remember my words?&mdash;'You have
wickedly abused the great bodily strength bestowed upon
you; I will paralyse that strength. The strongest have
trembled before you; I will make you henceforward
shrink in the presence of the weakest of beings.' You
have left the obscure retreat in which you might have
dwelt for repentance and expiation. You were afraid of
silence and solitude. You sought to drown remembrance
by new crimes. Just now, in a fearful and
bloodthirsty access of passion, you have wished to kill
your wife. She is here under the same roof as yourself.
She sleeps without defence. You have a knife. Her
apartment is close at hand. There was nothing to
prevent you from reaching her. Nothing could have
protected her from your rage&mdash;nothing but your impotence.
The dream you have had, and in which you are
still bound, may teach you much, may save you. The
mysterious phantoms of this dream bear with them a
most pregnant meaning. The lake of blood, in which
your victims have appeared, is the blood you have shed.
The molten lava which replaced it is the gnawing, eating
remorse, which must consume you before one day,
that the Almighty, having mercy on your protracted tortures,
shall call you to himself, and let you taste the ineffable
sweetness of his gracious forgiveness. But this
will not be. No, no! these warnings will be useless.
Far from repenting, you regret every day, with horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
blasphemies, the time when you could commit such atrocities.
Alas! from this continual struggle between your
bloodthirsty desires and the impossibility of satisfying
them,&mdash;between your habits of fierce oppression and the
compulsion of submitting to beings as weak as they are
depraved,&mdash;there will result to you a fate so fearful, so
appalling. Ah, unhappy wretch!"</p>

<p>Rodolph's voice faltered, and for a moment he was
silent, as if emotion and horror had hindered him from
proceeding. The Schoolmaster's hair bristled on his
brow. What could be&mdash;would be&mdash;that fate, which
even his executioner pitied?</p>

<p>"The fate that awaits you is so horrible," resumed
Rodolph, "that, if the Almighty, in his inexorable and
all-powerful vengeance, would make you in your person
expiate all the crimes of all mankind, he could not
devise a more fearful punishment! Ah, woe for you!
woe for you!"</p>

<p>At this moment the Schoolmaster uttered a piercing
shriek, and awoke with a bound at this horrid, frightful
dream.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h5>THE LETTER.</h5>


<p>The hour of nine had struck on the Bouqueval clock,
when Madame Georges softly entered the chamber of
Fleur-de-Marie. The light slumber of the young girl
was quickly broken, and she awoke to find her kind
friend standing by her bedside. A brilliant winter's sun
darted its rays through the blinds and chintz window-curtains,
the pink linings of which cast a bright glow on
the pale countenance of La Goualeuse, giving it the look
of health it so greatly needed.</p>

<p>"Well, my child," said Madame Georges, sitting down
and gently kissing her forehead, "how are you this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Much better, madame, I thank you."</p>

<p>"I hope you were not awoke very early this
morning?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, madame."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it; the blind man and his son, who
were permitted to sleep here last night, insisted upon
quitting the farm immediately it was light, and I was
fearful that the noise made in opening the gates might
have woke you."</p>

<p>"Poor things! why did they go so very early?"</p>

<p>"I know not. After you became more calm and
comfortable last night, I went down into the kitchen
for the purpose of seeing them, but they had pleaded
extreme weariness, and begged permission to retire.
Father Châtelain tells me the blind man does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
seem very right in his head; and the whole body of
servants were unanimous in praising the tenderness and
care with which the boy attended upon his blind parent.
But now, my dear Marie, listen to me; you must not
expose yourself to the risk of taking fresh cold after the
attack of fever you suffered from last night, and, therefore,
I recommend your keeping quite quiet all day, and
not leaving the parlour at all."</p>

<p>"Nay, madame, I have promised M. le Curé to be at
the rectory at five o'clock; pray allow me to go, as I am
expected."</p>

<p>"Indeed I cannot, it would be very imprudent; I can
perceive you have passed a very bad night, your eyes are
quite heavy."</p>

<p>"I have not been able to rest through the most frightful
dreams which pursued me whenever I tried to sleep.
I fancied myself in the power of a wicked woman who
used to torment me most cruelly when I was a child;
and I kept starting up in dread and alarm. I am
ashamed of such silly weakness as to allow dreams to
frighten me, but, indeed, I suffered so much during the
night that when I awoke my pillow was wetted with my
tears."</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry for this weakness, as you justly
style it, my dear child," said Madame Georges, with
affectionate concern, seeing the eyes of Fleur-de-Marie
again filling fast, "because I perceive the pain it
occasions you."</p>

<p>The poor girl, overpowered by her feelings, threw her
arms around the neck of her adopted mother and buried
her sobs in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Marie, Marie! my child, you terrify me; why, why
is this?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, dear madame, I beseech you! Indeed, I
know not myself what has come over me, but for the
last two days my heart has seemed full almost to bursting.
I cannot restrain my tears, though I know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
wherefore I weep. A fearful dread of some great evil
about to befall me weighs down my spirits and resists
every attempt to shake it off."</p>

<p>"Come! come! I shall scold you in earnest if you
thus give way to imaginary terrors."</p>

<p>At this moment Claudine, whose previous tap at the
door had been unheard, entered the room.</p>

<p>"What is it, Claudine?"</p>

<p>"Madame, Pierre has just arrived from Arnouville, in
Madame Dubreuil's chaise; he brings a letter for you
which he says is of great importance."</p>

<p>Madame Georges took the paper from Claudine's
hand, opened it and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Madame Georges</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">"You could do me a considerable favour, and assist me under
very perplexing circumstances, by hastening to the farm here
without delay. Pierre has orders to wait till you are ready, and
will drive you back after dinner. I really am in such confusion
that I hardly know what I am about. M. Dubreuil has gone to
the wool-fair at Pontoise; I have, therefore, no one to turn to for
advice and assistance but you and Marie. Clara sends her best
love to her very dear adopted sister, and anxiously expects her
arrival. Try to be with us by eleven o'clock, to luncheon.</p>

<p class="closesal">"Ever yours most sincerely,</p>
<p class="sigs"><span class="smcap">F. Dubreuil</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"What can possibly be the matter?" asked Madame
Georges of Fleur-de-Marie; "fortunately the tone of
Madame Dubreuil's letter is not calculated to cause
alarm."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to accompany you, madame?"
asked the Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"Why, that would scarcely be prudent, so cold as it is.
But, upon second thoughts," continued Madame Georges,
"I think you may venture if you wrap yourself up very
warm; it will serve to raise your spirits, and possibly
the short ride may do you good."</p>

<p>The Goualeuse did not immediately reply, but, after a
few minutes' consideration, she ventured to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, madame, M. le Curé expects me this evening,
at five o'clock, at the rectory."</p>

<p>"But I promise you to be back in good time for you
to keep your engagement; now will you go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, madame! Indeed, I shall be so
delighted to see Mlle. Clara."</p>

<p>"What! again?" uttered Madame Georges, in a tone
of gentle reproach. "Mlle. Clara? She does not speak
so distantly to you when she addresses you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, madame!" replied the poor girl, casting
down her eyes, while a bright flush rose even to her
temples; "but there is so great a difference between us
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Marie! you are cruel and unkind thus needlessly
to torment yourself. Have you so soon forgotten
how I chided you but just now for the very same fault?
There, drive away all such foolish thoughts! dress yourself
as quickly as you can, and pray wrap up very
carefully. If we are quick, we may reach Arnouville
before eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Then, leaving Fleur-de-Marie to perform the duties of
her simple toilet, Madame Georges retired to her own
chamber, first dismissing Claudine with an intimation to
Pierre that herself and niece would be ready to start
almost immediately.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards, Madame Georges and Marie
were on their way to Arnouville, in one of those large,
roomy cabriolets, in use among the rich farmers in the
environs of Paris; and briskly did their comfortable
vehicle, drawn by a stout Norman horse, roll over the
grassy road which led from Bouqueval to Arnouville.
The extensive buildings and numerous appendages to the
farm, tenanted by M. Dubreuil in the latter village, bore
testimony to the wealth and importance of the property
bestowed as a marriage-portion on Mlle. Césarine de Noirmont
upon her union with the Duke de Lucenay.</p>

<p>The loud crack of Pierre's whip apprised Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Dubreuil of the arrival of her friend, Madame Georges,
with Fleur-de-Marie, who were most affectionately greeted
by Clara and her mother. Madame Dubreuil was a good-looking
woman of middle age, with a countenance expressive
of extreme gentleness and kindness; while her
daughter Clara was a handsome brunette, with rich hazel
eyes, and a happy, innocent expression for ever resting
on her full, rosy lips, which seemed never to open but
to utter words of sweetness and amiability. As Clara
eagerly threw her arms around her friend's neck as she
descended the vehicle, the Goualeuse saw with extreme
surprise that the kind-hearted girl had laid aside her
more fashionable attire, and was habited as a simple
country maiden.</p>

<p>"Why, Clara!" said Madame Georges, affectionately
returning her embrace, "what is the meaning of this
strange costume?"</p>

<p>"It is done in imitation and admiration of her sister
Marie," answered Madame Dubreuil; "I assure you she
let me have no peace till I had procured her a woollen
bodice, and a fustian skirt exactly resembling your
Marie's. But, now we are talking of whims and caprices,
just come this way with me," added Madame
Dubreuil, drawing a deep sigh, "while I explain to you
my present difficulty, as well as the cause of my so
abruptly summoning you hither; but you are so kind,
I feel assured you will not only forgive it, but also
render me all the assistance I require."</p>

<p>Following Madame Georges and her mother to their
sitting-room, Clara lovingly conducted the Goualeuse
also thither, placing her in the warmest corner of the
fireside, and tenderly chafing her hands to prevent the
cold from affecting her; then fondly caressing her, and
styling her again and again her very dear sister Marie,
she playfully reproached her for allowing so long an interval
to pass away without paying her a visit. After
the recent conversation which passed between the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Goualeuse and the curé (no doubt fresh in the reader's
memory), it will easily be believed that these tender
marks of affection inspired the unfortunate girl with
feelings of deep humility, combined with a timid joy.</p>

<p>"Now, then, dear Madame Dubreuil," said Madame
Georges, when they were comfortably seated, "do pray
tell me what has happened, and in what manner I can
be serviceable to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, in several ways! I will tell you exactly how. In
the first place, I believe you are not aware that this
farm is the private property of the Duchesse de Lucenay,
and that we are accountable to her alone, having nothing
whatever to do with the duke or his steward."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I never heard that before."</p>

<p>"Neither should I have troubled you with so unimportant
a matter now, but that it forms a necessary part of
the explanation I am about to give you of my present
pressing need of your kind services. You must know,
then, that we consider ourselves as the tenants of
Madame de Lucenay, and always pay our rent either to
herself or to Madame Simon, her head <i>femme de chambre</i>;
and, really, spite of some little impetuosity of temper,
Madame la Duchesse is so amiable that it is delightful
to have business with her. Dubreuil and I would go
through fire and water to serve her: but, la! that is
only natural, considering we have known her from her
very cradle, and were accustomed to see her playing
about as a child during the visits she used annually to
pay to the estate during the lifetime of her late father,
the Prince de Noirmont. Latterly she has asked for
her rent in advance. Forty thousand francs is not
'picked up by the roadside,' as the old proverb says;
but happily we had laid that sum by as Clara's dowry,
and the very next morning after the request reached us
we carried madame her money in bright, shining, golden
louis. These great ladies spend so much, you see, in
luxuries such as you and I have no idea of. Yet it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
only within the last twelvemonth Madame de Lucenay
has wished to be paid beforehand, she used always to
seem as though she had plenty of money; but things are
very different now."</p>

<p>"Still, my dear Madame Dubreuil, I do not yet perceive
in what way I can possibly assist you."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry! I am just coming to that part
of my story; but I was obliged to tell you all this that
you might be able to understand the entire confidence
Madame la Duchesse places in us. To be sure, she showed
her great regard for us by becoming, when only thirteen
years of age, Clara's godmother, her noble father standing
as the other sponsor; and, ever since, Madame de
Lucenay has loaded her godchild with presents and kind
attentions. But I must not keep you&mdash;I see you are
impatient; so I will at once proceed with the business
part of my tale. You must know, then, that last night
I received by express the following letter from Madame
de Lucenay:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Madame Dubreuil</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">"'You must prepare the small pavilion in the orchard for
occupation by to-morrow evening. Send there all the requisite
furniture, such as carpets, curtains, etc., etc. Let nothing be
wanted to render it, in every respect, as <i>comfortable</i> as possible.'</p>
</div>

<p>"Do you mark the word 'comfortable,' Madame
Georges?" inquired Madame Dubreuil, pausing in the
midst of her reading; "it is even underlined." Then
looking up at her friend with a thoughtful, puzzled expression
of countenance, and receiving no answer, she
continued the perusal of her letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indent">"'It is so long since the pavilion has been used that it will
require large and constant fires both night and day to remove
the dampness from the walls. I wish you to behave in every respect
to the person who will occupy the apartments as you would
do to myself. And you will receive by the hands of the new
visitant a letter from me explanatory of all I expect from your
well-known zeal and attachment. I depend entirely on you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
feel every assurance that I may safely reckon on your fidelity
and desire to serve me. Adieu, my dear Madame Dubreuil;
remember me most kindly to my pretty goddaughter; and believe
me ever,</p>

<p class="closesal">"'Yours, sincerely and truly,</p>
<p class="sigs">"'<span class="smcap">Noirmont de Lucenay</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"'P.S. The person whom I so strongly recommend to your
best care and attention will arrive the day after to-morrow, about
dusk. Pray do your very utmost to render the pavilion as <i>comfortable</i>
as you possibly can.'</p>
</div>

<p>"Comfortable again, you see, and underlined as before,"
said Madame Dubreuil, returning the letter of
Madame de Lucenay to her pocket.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Madame Georges, "all this is simple
enough!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, simple enough? you cannot have
heard me read the letter. Madame la Duchesse wishes
particularly 'that the pavilion should be rendered as
comfortable as possible.' Now that is the very reason
of my asking you to come to me to-day; Clara and I
have been knocking our heads together in vain to discover
what 'comfortable' can possibly mean, but without
being able to find it out. Yet it seems odd, too, that
Clara should not know its meaning, for she was several
years at school at Villiers le Bel, and gained a quantity
of prizes for history and geography; however, she knows
as little as I do about that outlandish word. I dare say
it is only known at court, or in the fashionable world.
However, be that as it may, Madame la Duchesse has
thrown me into a pretty fuss by making use of it; she
says, and you see twice repeats the words, and even
underlines it, 'that she requests I will furnish the pavilion
as comfortably as possible.' Now what are we to
do when we have not the slightest notion of the meaning
of that word?"</p>

<p>"Well, heaven be praised, then, that I can relieve
your perplexity by solving this grand mystery!" said
Madame Georges, smiling. "Upon the present occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the word comfortable merely means an assemblage of
neat, well-chosen, well-arranged, and convenient furniture,
so placed, in apartments well warmed and protected
from cold or damp, that the occupant shall find every
thing that is necessary combined with articles that to
some might seem superfluities."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I perfectly understand what comfortable
means as regards furnishing apartments; but your explanation
only increases my difficulties."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse speaks of carpets, furniture,
and many <i>et c&oelig;teras</i>; now we have no carpets here,
and our furniture is of the most homely description.
Neither can I make out by the letter whether the person
I am to expect is a male or female; and yet every
thing must be prepared by to-morrow evening. What
shall I do? What can I do? I can get nothing here.
Really, Madame Georges, it is enough to drive one wild
to be placed in such an awkward situation."</p>

<p>"But, mother," said Clara, "suppose you take the
furniture out of my room, and whilst you are refurnishing
it I will go and pass a few days with dear Marie at
Bouqueval."</p>

<p>"My dear child, what nonsense you talk! as if the
humble fittings-up of your chamber could equal what
Madame la Duchesse means by the word 'comfortable,'"
returned Madame Dubreuil, with a disconsolate shrug of
the shoulders. "Lord! Lord! why will fine ladies
puzzle poor folks like me by going out of their way to
find such expressions as comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Then I presume the pavilion in question is ordinarily
uninhabited?" said Madame Georges.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! There, you see that small white building
at the end of the orchard&mdash;that is it. The late Prince
de Noirmont, father of Madame la Duchesse, caused it
to be built for his daughter when, in her youthful days,
she was accustomed to visit the farm, and she then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
occupied it. There are three pretty chambers in it, and
a beautiful little Swiss dairy at the end of the garden,
where, in her childish days, Madame la Duchesse used
to divert herself with feigning to manage. Since her
marriage, she has only been twice at the farm, but each
time she passed several hours in the pavilion. The
first time was about six years ago, and then she came
on horseback with&mdash;" Then, as though the presence of
Clara and Fleur-de-Marie prevented her from saying
more, Madame Dubreuil interrupted herself by saying,
"But I am talking instead of doing; and that is not the
way to get out of my present difficulty. Come, dear,
good Madame Georges, and help a poor bewildered
creature like myself!"</p>

<p>"In the first place," answered Madame Georges,
"tell me how is this pavilion furnished at the present
moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, scarcely at all! In the principal apartment
there is a straw matting on the centre of the floor; a
sofa, and a few arm-chairs composed of rushes, a table,
and some chairs, comprise all the inventory, which, I
think you will allow, falls far short of the word
comfortable."</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you what I should do in your place.
Let me see; it is eleven o'clock. I should send a
person on whom you can depend to Paris."</p>

<p>"Our overseer!<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There cannot be a more active,
intelligent person."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A species of overseer employed in most of the large farming establishments
in the environs of Paris.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Exactly! just the right sort of messenger. Well,
in two hours at the utmost, he may be in Paris. Let
him go to some upholsterer in the Chaussée d'Antin&mdash;never
mind which&mdash;and give him the list I will draw
out, after I have seen what is wanting for the pavilion;
and let him be directed to say that, let the expense be
what it may&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't care about expense, if I can but satisfy the
duchess."</p>

<p>"The upholsterer, then, must be told that, at any
cost, he must see that every article named in the list
be sent here either this evening or before daybreak to-morrow,
with three or four of his most clever and active
workmen to arrange them as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"They might come by the Gonesse diligence, which
leaves Paris at eight o'clock every evening."</p>

<p>"And as they would only have to place the furniture,
lay down carpets, and put up curtains, all that could
easily be done by to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Madame Georges, what a load you have
taken off my mind! I should never have thought of
this simple yet proper manner of proceeding. You are
the saving of me! Now, may I ask you to be so kind
as to draw me out the list of articles necessary to render
the pavilion&mdash;what is that hard word? I never can
recollect it."</p>

<p>"Comfortable! Yes, I will at once set about it, and
with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Dear me! here is another difficulty. Don't you see
we are not told whether to expect a lady or a gentleman?
Madame de Lucenay, in her letter, only says 'a
person.' It is very perplexing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Then make your preparations as if for a lady, my
dear Madame Dubreuil; and, should it turn out a gentleman,
why he will only have better reason to be pleased
with his accommodations."</p>

<p>"Quite right; right again, as you always are."</p>

<p>A servant here announced that breakfast was
ready.</p>

<p>"Let breakfast wait a little," said Madame Georges.
"And, while I draw out the necessary list, send some
person you can depend upon to take the exact height
and width of the three rooms, that the curtains and
carpets may more easily be prepared."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you. I will set our overseer to work out
this commission."</p>

<p>"Madame," continued the servant, speaking to her
mistress, "the new dairy-woman from Stains is here
with her few goods in a small cart drawn by a donkey.
The beast has not a heavy load to complain of, for the
poor body's luggage seems but very trifling."</p>

<p>"Poor woman!" said Madame Dubreuil, kindly.</p>

<p>"What woman is it?" inquired Madame Georges.</p>

<p>"A poor creature from Stains, who once had four
cows of her own, and used to go every morning to Paris
to sell her milk. Her husband was a blacksmith, and
one day accompanied her to Paris to purchase some iron
he required for his work, agreeing to rejoin her at the
corner of the street where she was accustomed to sell
her milk. Unhappily, as it afterwards turned out, the
poor woman had selected a very bad part of Paris; for,
when her husband returned, he found her in the midst
of a set of wicked, drunken fellows, who had, for mere
mischief's sake, upset all her milk into the gutter. The
poor blacksmith tried to reason with them upon the
score of their unfair conduct, but that only made matters
worse; they all fell on the husband, who sought in
vain to defend himself from their violence. The end of
the story is, that, in the scuffle which ensued, the man
received a stab with a knife, which stretched him a
corpse before the eyes of his distracted wife."</p>

<p>"Dreadful, indeed!" ejaculated Madame Georges.
"But, at least, the murderer was apprehended?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no! He managed to make his escape during
the confusion which ensued, though the unfortunate
widow asserts she should recognise him at any minute
she might meet him, having repeatedly seen him in company
with his associates, inhabitants of that neighbourhood.
However, up to the present hour all attempts
to discover him have been useless. But, to end my tale,
I must tell you that, in consequence of the death of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
husband, the poor widow was compelled, in order to pay
various debts he had contracted, to sell not only her
cows but some little land he possessed. The bailiff of
the château at Stains recommended the poor creature to
me as a most excellent and honest woman, as deserving
as she was unfortunate, having three children to provide
for, the eldest not yet twelve years of age. I happened,
just then, to be in want of a first-rate dairy-woman,
therefore offered her the place, which she gladly accepted,
and she has now come to take up her abode on
the farm."</p>

<p>"This act of real kindness on your part, my dear
Madame Dubreuil, does not surprise me, knowing you
as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Here, Clara," said Madame Dubreuil, as though
seeking to escape from the praises of her friend, "will
you go and show this good woman the way to the lodge
she is to occupy, while I hasten to explain to our overseer
the necessity for his immediate departure for
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, dear mother! Marie can come with me,
can she not?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Madame Dubreuil, "if she
pleases." Then added, smilingly, "I wonder whether
you two girls could do one without the other!"</p>

<p>"And now," said Madame Georges, seating herself
before a table, "I will at once begin my part of the
business, that no time may be lost; for we must positively
return to Bouqueval at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Madame Dubreuil; "how
early! Why, what makes you in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Marie is obliged to be at the rectory by five
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, if her return relates to that good Abbé Laporte,
I am sure it is a sacred duty with which I would not
interfere for the world. Well, then, I will go and give
the necessary orders for everything being punctual to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
that hour. Those two girls have so much to say to
each other that we must give them as much time as we
can."</p>

<p>"Then we shall leave you at three o'clock, my dear
Madame Dubreuil?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I promise not to detain you since you so positively
wish it. But pray let me thank you again and
again for coming. What a good thing it was I thought
of sending to ask your kind assistance," rejoined
Madame Dubreuil. "Now then, Clara and Marie, off
with you!"</p>

<p>As Madame Georges settled herself to her writing,
Madame Dubreuil quitted the room by a door on one
side, while the young friends, in company with the servant
who had announced the arrival of the milkwoman
from Stains, went out by the opposite side.</p>

<p>"Where is the poor woman?" inquired Clara.</p>

<p>"There she is, mademoiselle, in the courtyard, near
the barns, with her children and her little donkey-cart."</p>

<p>"You shall see her, dear Marie," said Clara, taking
the arm of la Goualeuse. "Poor woman! she looks so
pale and sad in her deep widow's mourning. The last
time she came here to arrange with my mother about
the place she made my heart ache. She wept bitterly
as she spoke of her husband; then suddenly burst into
a fit of rage as she mentioned his murderer. Really,
she quite frightened me, she looked so desperate and
full of fury. But, after all, her resentment was natural.
Poor thing! I am sure I pity her; some people are very
unfortunate, are they not, Marie?"</p>

<p>"Alas, yes, they are, indeed!" replied the Goualeuse,
sighing deeply. "There are some persons who appear
born only to trouble and sorrow, as you justly observe,
Miss Clara."</p>

<p>"This is really very unkind of you, Marie," said
Clara, colouring with impatience and displeasure.
"This is the second time to-day you have called me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
'Miss Clara.' What can I have possibly done to offend
you? For I am sure you must be angry with me, or
you would not do what you know vexes me so very
much."</p>

<p>"How is it possible that you could ever offend me?"</p>

<p>"Then why do you say 'miss?' You know very
well that both Madame Georges and my mother have
scolded you for doing it. And I give you due warning,
if ever you repeat this great offence, I will have you
well scolded again. Now then, will you be good or
not? Speak!"</p>

<p>"Dear Clara, pray pardon me! Indeed, I was not
thinking when I spoke."</p>

<p>"Not thinking!" repeated Clara, sorrowfully. "What,
after eight long days' absence you cannot give me your
attention even for five minutes? Not thinking! That
would be bad enough; but that is not it, Marie. And
I tell you what, it is my belief you are too proud to own
so humble a friend as myself."</p>

<p>Fleur-de-Marie made no answer, but her whole countenance
assumed the pallor of death.</p>

<p>A woman, dressed as a widow, and in deep mourning,
had just caught sight of her, and uttered a cry of rage
and horror which seemed to freeze the poor girl's blood.
This woman was the person who supplied the Goualeuse
with her daily milk, during the time the latter dwelt
with the ogress at the <i>tapis-franc</i>.</p>

<p>The scene which ensued took place in one of the
yards belonging to the farm, in the presence of all the
labourers, both male and female, who chanced just then
to be returning to the house to take their mid-day meal.
Beneath a shed stood a small cart, drawn by a donkey,
and containing the few household possessions of the
widow; a boy of about twelve years of age, aided by
two younger children, was beginning to unload the vehicle.
The milk-woman herself was a woman of about
forty years of age, her countenance coarse, masculine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and expressive of great resolution. She was, as we
before stated, attired in the deepest mourning, and her
eyelids looked red and inflamed with recent weeping.
Her first impulse at the sight of the Goualeuse had been
terror; but quickly did that feeling change into grief
and rage, while the most violent anger contracted her
features. Rapidly darting towards the unhappy girl,
she seized her by the arm, and, presenting her to the
gaze of the farm servants, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here is a creature who is acquainted with the
assassin of my poor husband! I have seen her more
than twenty times speaking to the ruffian when I was
selling my milk at the corner of the Rue de la Vieille-Draperie;
she used to come to buy a ha'porth every
morning. She knows well enough who it was struck
the blow that made me a widow, and my poor children
fatherless. 'Birds of a feather flock together,' and such
loose characters as she is are sure to be linked in with
thieves and murderers. Oh, you shall not escape me,
you abandoned wretch!" cried the milk-woman, who
had now lashed herself into a perfect fury, and who,
seeing poor Fleur-de-Marie confused and terror-stricken
at this sudden attack, endeavouring to escape from it
by flight, grasped her fiercely by the other arm also.
Clara, almost speechless with surprise and alarm at this
outrageous conduct, had been quite incapable of interfering;
but this increased violence on the part of the
widow seemed to restore her to herself, and angrily
addressing the woman she said:</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this improper behaviour?
Are you out of your senses? Has grief turned your
brain? Good woman, I pity you! But let us pass on;
you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"Mistaken!" repeated the woman, with a bitter smile.
"Me mistaken! No, no, there is no mistake! Just look
at her pale, guilty looks! Hark how her very teeth rattle
in her head! Ah, she knows well enough there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
mistake! Ah, you may hold your wicked tongue if you
like, but justice will find a way to make you speak.
You shall go with me before the mayor; do you hear?
Oh, it is not worth while resisting! I have good strong
wrists; I can hold you. And sooner than you should
escape I would carry you every step of the way."</p>

<p>"You good-for-nothing, insolent woman! How dare
you presume to speak in this way to my dear friend and
sister?"</p>

<p>"Your sister, Mlle. Clara! Believe me, it is you who
are deceived&mdash;it is you who have lost your senses,"
bawled the enraged milk-woman, in a loud, coarse voice.
"Your sister! A likely story a girl out of the streets,
who was the companion of the very lowest wretches in
the worst part of the Cité, should be a sister of yours!"</p>

<p>At these words the assembled labourers, who naturally
enough took that part in the affair which concerned a
person of their own class, and who really sympathised
with the bereaved milk-woman, gave utterance to deep,
threatening words, in which the name of Fleur-de-Marie
was angrily mingled. The three children, hearing their
mother speaking in a loud tone, and fearing they knew
not what, ran to her, and, clinging to her dress, burst
out into a loud fit of weeping. The sight of these poor
little fatherless things, dressed also in deep mourning,
increased the pity of the spectators for the unfortunate
widow, while it redoubled their indignation against Fleur-de-Marie;
while Clara, completely frightened by these
demonstrations of approaching violence, exclaimed, in an
agitated tone, to a group of farm labourers:</p>

<p>"Take this woman off the premises directly! Do you
not perceive grief has driven her out of her senses?
Marie! dear Marie! never mind what she says. She is
mad, poor creature, and knows not what she does!"</p>

<p>The poor Goualeuse, pale, exhausted, and almost fainting,
made no effort to escape from the powerful grasp of
the incensed milk-woman; she hung her head, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
unable or unwilling to meet the gaze of friend or foe.
Clara, attributing her condition to the terror excited by
so alarming a scene, renewed her commands to the
labourers, "Did you not hear me desire that this mad
woman might be instantly taken away from the farm?
However, unless she immediately ceases her rude and
insolent language, I can promise her, by way of punishment,
she shall neither have the situation my mother
promised her nor ever be suffered to put her foot on the
premises again."</p>

<p>Not a person stirred to obey Clara's orders; on the
contrary, one of the boldest among the party exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, but, Miss Clara, if your friend there is only a
common girl out of the streets, and, as such, acquainted
with the murderer of this poor woman's husband, surely
she ought to go before the mayor to give an account of
herself and her bad companions!"</p>

<p>"I tell you," repeated Clara, with indignant warmth,
and addressing the milk-woman, "you shall never enter
this farm again unless you this very instant, and before
all these people, humbly beg pardon of Mlle. Marie for
all the wicked things you have been saying about her!"</p>

<p>"You turn me off the premises then, mademoiselle, do
you?" retorted the widow with bitterness. "Well, so
be it. Come, my poor children, let us put the things
back in the cart, and go and seek our bread elsewhere.
God will take care of us. But, at least, when we go, we
will take this abandoned young woman with us. She
shall be made to tell the mayor, if she won't us, who it
was that took away your dear father's life; for she knows
well enough&mdash;she who was the daily companion of the
worst set of ruffians who infest Paris. And you, miss,"
added she, looking spitefully and insolently at Clara,
"you should not, because you choose to make friends
with low girls out of the streets, and because you happen
to be rich, be quite so hard-hearted and unfeeling to poor
creatures like me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more she ought," exclaimed one of the labourers;
"the poor woman is right!"</p>

<p>"Of course she is,&mdash;she is only standing up for her
own!"</p>

<p>"Poor thing, she has no one now to do so for her!
Why, they have murdered her husband among them! I
should think that might content them, without trampling
the poor woman under foot."</p>

<p>"One comfort is, nobody can stop her from doing all
in her power to bring the murderers of her husband to
justice."</p>

<p>"It is a shame to send her away in this manner, like
a dog!"</p>

<p>"Can she help it, poor creature, if Miss Clara thinks
proper to take up with common girls and thieves, and
make them her companions?"</p>

<p>"Infamous to turn an honest woman, a poor widow
with helpless children, into the streets for such a base
girl as that!"</p>

<p>These different speeches, uttered nearly simultaneously
by the surrounding crowd, were rapidly assuming
a most hostile and threatening tone, when Clara joyfully
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Thank God, here comes my mother!"</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Madame Dubreuil, who was crossing
the courtyard on her return from the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Now, then, my children," said Madame Dubreuil,
gaily approaching the assembled group, "will you come
in to breakfast? I declare it is quite late! I dare say
you are both hungry? Come, Marie!&mdash;Clara!"</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Clara, pointing to the widow, "you
are fortunately just in time to save my dear sister Marie
from the insults and violence of that woman. Oh, pray
order her away instantly! If you only knew what she
had the audacity to say to Marie!"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Clara!"</p>

<p>"Nay, but, dear mother, only look at my poor dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
sister! See how she trembles! She can scarcely support
herself. Oh, it is a shame and disgrace such conduct
should ever have been offered to a guest of ours! My
dear, dear friend&mdash;Marie, dear!&mdash;look up, and say
you are not angry with us. Pray tell me you will
try and forget it!"</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" inquired Madame
Dubreuil, looking around her with a disturbed and uneasy
look, after having observed the despairing agony of
the Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we shall have justice done the poor widow
woman!" murmured the labourers. "Madame will see
her righted, no doubt about it!"</p>

<p>"Now, then," exclaimed the milk-woman, exultingly,
"here is Madame Dubreuil. Now, my fine miss," continued
she, addressing Fleur-de-Marie, "you will have
your turn of being turned out-of-doors!"</p>

<p>"Is it true, then," cried Madame Dubreuil, addressing
the widow, who still kept firm hold of Fleur-de-Marie's
arm, "that you have dared to insult my daughter's
friend, as she asserts? Is this the way you show your
gratitude for all I have done to serve you? Will you
leave that young lady alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," replied the woman, relinquishing her
grasp of Fleur-de-Marie, "at your bidding I will; for I
respect you too much to disobey you. And, besides,
I owe you much gratitude for all your kindness to a
poor, friendless creature like myself. But, before you
blame me, and drive me off the premises with my poor
children, just question that wretched creature that has
caused all this confusion what she knows of me. I know
a pretty deal more of her than is to her credit!"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Marie," exclaimed Madame
Dubreuil, almost petrified with astonishment, "What
does this woman allude to? Do you hear what she says?"</p>

<p>"Are you, or are you not known by the name of
the Goualeuse?" said the milk-woman to Marie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the wretched girl, in a low, trembling
voice, and without venturing to lift up her eyes towards
Madame Dubreuil,&mdash;"yes, I am called so."</p>

<p>"There you see!" vociferated the enraged labourers.
"She owns it! she owns it!"</p>

<p>"What does she own?" inquired Madame Dubreuil,
half frightened at the assent given by Fleur-de-Marie.</p>

<p>"Leave her to me, madame," resumed the widow,
"and you shall hear her confess that she was living in
a house of the most infamous description in the Rue-aux-Fêves
in the Cité, and that she every morning purchased
a half-pennyworth of milk of me. She cannot
deny either having repeatedly spoken in my presence to
the murderer of my poor husband. Oh, she knows him
well enough, I am quite certain; a pale young man,
who smoked a good deal, and always wore a cap and
a blouse, and wore his hair very long; she could tell
his name if she chose. Is this true, or is it a lie?"
vociferously demanded the milk-woman.</p>

<p>"I may have spoken to the man who killed your husband,"
answered Fleur-de-Marie, in a faint voice; "for,
unhappily, there are more than one in the Cité capable
of such a crime. But, indeed, I know not of
whom you are speaking!"</p>

<p>"What does she say?" asked Madame Dubreuil, horror-struck
at her words. "She admits having possibly
conversed with murderers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, such lost wretches as she is," replied the widow,
"have no better companions!"</p>

<p>At first, utterly stupefied by so singular a discovery,
confirmed, indeed, by Fleur-de-Marie's own admission,
Madame Dubreuil seemed almost incapable of comprehending
the scene before her; but quickly the whole
truth presented itself to her mental vision, and shrinking
from the unfortunate girl with horror and disgust, she
hastily seized her daughter by the dress, as she was
about to sustain the sinking form of the poor Goualeuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and, drawing her towards her with sudden violence,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Clara! For Heaven's sake approach not that vile,
that abandoned young woman! Oh, dreadful, indeed,
ever to have admitted her here! But how came Madame
Georges to have her under her roof? And how
could she so far insult me as to bring her here, and
allow my daughter to&mdash;This is, indeed, disgraceful!
I hardly know whether to trust the evidence of my own
senses. But Madame Georges must have been as much
imposed on as myself, or she never would have permitted
such an indignity! No, no! She is incapable of such
dishonourable conduct. It would, indeed, be a disgrace
for one female so to have deceived another."</p>

<p>Poor Clara, terrified and almost heart-broken at this
distressing scene, could scarcely believe herself awake.
It seemed as though she were under the influence of a
fearful dream. Her innocent and pure mind comprehended
not the frightful charges brought against her
friend; but she understood enough to fill her with the
most poignant grief at the unfortunate position of La
Goualeuse, who stood mute, passive and downcast, like
a criminal in the presence of the judge.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my child," repeated Madame Dubreuil,
"let us quit this disgraceful scene." Then, turning
towards Fleur-de-Marie, she said:</p>

<p>"As for you, worthless girl, the Almighty will punish
you as you deserve for your deceit! That my child,
good and virtuous as she is, should ever have been
allowed to call you sister or friend. Her sister! You&mdash;the
very vilest of the vile! the outcast of the most
depraved and lost wretches! What hardihood, what
effrontery you must have possessed, to dare to show
your face among good and honest people, when your
proper place would have been along with your bad
companions in a prison!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" cried all the labourers at once; "let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
be sent off to prison at once. She knows the murderer!
Let her be made to declare who and what he is."</p>

<p>"She is most likely his accomplice!"</p>

<p>"You see," exclaimed the widow, doubling her fist in
the face of the Goualeuse, "that my words have come
true. Justice will overtake you before you can commit
other crimes."</p>

<p>"As for you, my good woman," said Madame Dubreuil
to the milk-woman, "far from sending you away I shall
reward you for the service you have done me in unmasking
this infamous girl's real character."</p>

<p>"There, I told you," murmured the voices of the
labourers, "our mistress always does justice to every
one!"</p>

<p>"Come, Clara," resumed Madame Dubreuil, "let us
retire and seek Madame Georges, that she may clear up
her share of this disgraceful business, or she and I never
meet again; for either she has herself been most dreadfully
deceived, or her conduct towards us is of the very
worst description."</p>

<p>"But, mother, only look at poor Marie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind her! Let her die of shame, if she
likes,&mdash;there will be one wicked, hardened girl less in
the world. Treat her with the contempt she deserves.
I will not suffer you to remain another instant where
she is. It is impossible for a young person like you to
notice her in any way without disgracing herself."</p>

<p>"My dear mother," answered Clara, resisting her
mother's attempts to draw her away, "I do not understand
what you mean. Marie must be wrong in some
way, since you say so! But look, only look at her&mdash;she
is fainting! Pity her! Oh, mother, let her be ever
so guilty, pray take pity on her present distress!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mlle. Clara, you are good&mdash;very, very good&mdash;to
pardon me and care for me," uttered poor Fleur-de-Marie,
in a faint voice, casting a look of unutterable
gratitude on her young protectress. "Believe me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
it was sorely against my will ever to deceive you; and
daily, hourly, have I reproached myself for so doing."</p>

<p>"Mother," exclaimed Clara, in the most piteous tones,
"are you then so merciless? Can you not pity her?"</p>

<p>"Pity!" returned Madame Dubreuil, scornfully. "No,
I waste no pity on such as she is. Come, I say! Were
it not that I consider it the office of Madame Georges to
clear the place of so vile a creature, I would have her
spurned from the doors, as though she carried the
plague about with her." So saying, the angry mother
seized her daughter's hand, and, spite of all her struggles,
led her away, Clara continually turning back her
head, and saying:</p>

<p>"Marie, my sister, I know not what they accuse you
of, but I am quite convinced of your innocence. Be
assured of my constant love, whatever they may say
or do."</p>

<p>"Silence! silence! I command!" cried Madame Dubreuil,
placing her hand over her daughter's mouth.
"Speak not another word, I insist! Fortunately, we
have plenty of witnesses to testify that, after the odious
discovery we have just made, you were not suffered to
remain a single instant with this lost and unfortunate
young woman. You can all answer for that, can you
not, my good people?" continued she, speaking to the
assembled labourers.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, madame," replied one of them, "we all
know well enough that Mlle. Clara was not allowed to
stop with this bad girl a single instant after you found
out her wickedness. No doubt she is a thief or she
would not be so intimate with murderers."</p>

<p>Madame Dubreuil led Clara to the house, while the
Goualeuse remained in the midst of the hostile circle
which had now formed around her. Spite of the
reproaches of Madame Dubreuil, her presence, and that
of Clara, had, in some degree, served to allay the fears
of Fleur-de-Marie as to the probable termination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
scene. But, after the departure of both mother and
daughter, when she found herself so entirely at the
mercy of the enraged crowd, her strength seemed to
forsake her, and she was obliged to keep herself from
falling by leaning on the parapet of the deep watering-place
where the farm cattle were accustomed to drink.</p>

<p>Nothing could be conceived more touching than the
attitude of the unfortunate girl, nor could a more threatening
appearance have been displayed than was exhibited
in the words and looks of the countrymen and women
who surrounded her. Seated, or rather supporting herself
on the narrow margin of the wall which enclosed
the drinking-place, her head hanging down, and concealed
by both hands, her neck and bosom hid by the
ends of the little red cotton handkerchief which was
twisted around her cap, the poor Goualeuse, mute and
motionless, presented a most touching picture of grief
and resignation.</p>

<p>At some little distance from Fleur-de-Marie stood the
widow of the murdered man. Triumphant in her vindictive
rage, and still further excited by the indignation
expressed by Madame Dubreuil, she pointed out the
wretched object of her wrath to the labourers and her
children, with gestures of contempt and detestation.
The farm servants, who had now formed into a close
circle, sought not to conceal their disgust and thirst for
vengeance; their rude countenances expressed at once
rage, desire for revenge, and a sort of insulting raillery.
The women were even still more bitter, and bent upon
mischief. Neither did the striking beauty of the Goualeuse
tend to allay their wrath. But neither men nor
women could pardon Fleur-de-Marie the heinous offence
of having, up to that hour, been treated by their superiors
as an equal; and some of the men now present,
having been unsuccessful candidates for the vacant situations
at Bouqueval, and attributing their failure to
Madame Georges, when, in reality, their disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
arose entirely from their recommendations not being
sufficiently satisfactory, determined to avail themselves
of the opportunity now before them to wreak their vexation
and ill-will on the head of one she was known
to protect and love. The impulses of ignorant minds
always lead to extremes either of good or bad. But
they speedily put on a most dangerous form, when the
fury of an enraged multitude is directed against those
who may already have awakened their personal anger
or aversion.</p>

<p>Although the greater number of the labourers now
collected together might not have been so strictly virtuous
and free from moral blame as to be justified in
throwing the first stone at the trembling, fainting girl,
who was the object of all their concentrated wrath, yet,
on the present occasion, they unanimously spoke and
acted as though her very presence was capable of contaminating
them; and their delicacy and modesty alike
revolted at the bare recollection of the depraved class to
which she had belonged, and they shuddered to be so
near one who confessed to having frequently conversed
with assassins. Nothing, then, was wanting to urge on
a blind and prejudiced crowd, still further instigated by
the example of Madame Dubreuil.</p>

<p>"Take her before the mayor!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! and, if she won't walk, we'll drag her."</p>

<p>"And for her to have the impudence to dress herself
like one of us honest girls!" said an awkward, ill-looking
farm-wench.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," rejoined another female, with her mock-modest
air, "one might have thought she would go to
heaven, spite of priest or confession!"</p>

<p>"Why, she had the assurance even to attend mass!"</p>

<p>"No! Did she? Why did she not join in the communion
afterwards then, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"And then she must play the young lady, and hold
up her head as high as our betters!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"As though we were not good company enough for
her!"</p>

<p>"However, every dog has his day!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make you find your tongue, and tell who it
was took my husband's life!" vociferated the enraged
widow, breaking out into a fresh storm, now she felt her
party so strong. "You all belong to one gang; and I'm
not sure but I saw you among them at the very time
and place when the bloody deed was done! Come,
come; don't stand there shedding your crocodile tears;
you are found out, and may as well leave off shamming
any more. Show your face, I say! You are a beauty,
ain't you?" And the infuriated woman, suiting the
action to the word, violently snatched the two hands of
poor Fleur-de-Marie from the pale and grief-worn countenance
they concealed, and down which tears were fast
streaming.</p>

<p>The Goualeuse, sinking under a sense of shame, and
terrified at finding herself thus at the mercy of her persecutors,
joined her hands, and, turning towards the
milk-woman her supplicating and timid looks, she said,
in a gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, madam, I have been at the farm of
Bouqueval these last two months. How could I, then,
have been witness to the dreadful misfortune you speak
of? And&mdash;"</p>

<p>The faint tones of Fleur-de-Marie's voice were
drowned in the loud uproarious cries of the surrounding
multitude.</p>

<p>"Let us take her before the mayor! She can speak;
and she shall, too, to some purpose. March, march, my
fine madam! On with you!"</p>

<p>So saying, the menacing crowd pressed upon the poor
girl, who, mechanically crossing her hands on her bosom,
looked eagerly around, as though in search of help.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the milk-woman, "you need not stare
about in that wild way. Mlle. Clara is not here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
now to take your part. You don't slip through my
fingers, I promise you!"</p>

<p>"Alas! madam," uttered Fleur-de-Marie, trembling
violently, "I seek not to escape from you. Be assured,
I am both ready and willing to answer all the questions
put to me, if I can be of any service to you by so
doing. But what harm have I done to these people,
who surround and threaten me in this manner?"</p>

<p>"What have you done?" repeated a number of
voices, "why, you have dared to stick yourself up with
our betters, when we, who were worth thousands more
than such as you, were made to keep our distance,&mdash;that's
what you have done!"</p>

<p>"And what right had you to cause this poor woman
to be turned away with her fatherless children?" cried
another.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it was no fault of mine. It was Mlle.
Clara, who wished&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is not true!" interrupted the speaker. "You
never even opened your mouth in her favour. No, not
you? You were too well pleased to see her bread taken
from her."</p>

<p>"No, no! no more she did," chimed in a burst of
voices, male and female.</p>

<p>"She is a regular bad one!"</p>

<p>"A poor widow-woman, with three helpless children!"</p>

<p>"If I did not plead for her with Mlle. Clara, it was
because I had not power to utter a word."</p>

<p>"You could find strength enough to talk to a set of
thieves and murderers!"</p>

<p>And, as is frequently the case in public commotions,
the country people, more ignorant than vicious, actually
talked themselves into a fury, until their own words and
violence excited them to fresh acts of rage and vengeance
against their unhappy victim.</p>

<p>The menacing throng, gesticulating, and loudly threatening,
advanced closer and closer towards Fleur-de-Marie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
while the widow appeared to have lost all
command over herself. Separated from the deep pond
only by the parapet on which she was leaning, the
Goualeuse shuddered at the idea of their throwing
her into the water; and, extending towards them her
supplicating hands, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Good, kind people! what do you want with me?
For pity's sake do not harm me!"</p>

<p>And as the milk-woman, with fierce and angry gestures,
kept coming nearer and nearer, holding her
clenched fist almost in the face of Fleur-de-Marie, the
poor girl, drawing herself back in terror, said, in
beseeching tones:</p>

<p>"Pray, pray, do not press so closely on me, or you
will cause me to fall into the water."</p>

<p>These words suggested a cruel idea to the rough spectators.
Intending merely one of those practical jokes
which, however diverting to the projectors, are fraught
with serious harm and suffering to the unfortunate
object of them, one of the most violent of the number
called out, "Let's give her a plunge in! Duck her!
duck her!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" chimed several voices, accompanied with
brutal laughter, and noisy clapping of hands, with other
tokens of unanimous approval. "Throw her in!&mdash;in
with her!"</p>

<p>"A good dip will do her good! Water won't kill
her!"</p>

<p>"That will teach her not to show her face among
honest people again!"</p>

<p>"To be sure. Toss her in!&mdash;fling her over!"</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the ice was broken this morning!"</p>

<p>"And when she has had her bath she may go and tell
her street companions how the folks at Arnouville farm
serve such vile girls as she is!"</p>

<p>As these unfeeling speeches reached her ear, as she
heard their barbarous jokes, and observed the exasperated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
looks of the brutally excited individuals who
approached her to carry their threat into execution,
Fleur-de-Marie gave herself over for lost. But to her
first horror of a violent death succeeded a sort of gloomy
satisfaction. The future wore so threatening and hopeless
an aspect for her that she thanked heaven for
shortening her trial. Not another complaining word
escaped her; but gently falling on her knees, and piously
folding her hands upon her breast, she closed her eyes,
and meekly resigned herself to her fate.</p>

<p>The labourers, surprised at the attitude and mute
resignation of the Goualeuse, hesitated a moment in the
accomplishment of their savage design; but, rallied on
their folly and irresolution by the female part of the
assemblage, they recommenced their uproarious cries, as
though to inspire themselves with the necessary courage
to complete their wicked purpose.</p>

<p>Just as two of the most furious of the party were
about to seize on Fleur-de-Marie a loud, thrilling voice
was heard, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Stop! I command you!"</p>

<p>And at the very instant Madame Georges, who had
forced a passage through the crowd, reached the still
kneeling Goualeuse, took her in her arms, and, raising
her, cried:</p>

<p>"Rise up, my child! Stand up, my beloved daughter!
the knee should be bent to God alone!"</p>

<p>The expression and attitude of Madame Georges were
so full of courageous firmness that the actors in this
cruel scene shrunk back speechless and confounded.
Indignation coloured her usually pale features, and
casting on the labourers a stern look she said to
them, in a loud and threatening voice:</p>

<p>"Wretches! Are you not ashamed of such brutal
conduct to a helpless girl like this?"</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My daughter!" exclaimed Madame Georges, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
severity, and abruptly interrupting the man who was
about to speak, "and, as such, both cherished and
protected by our worthy curé, M. l'Abbé Laporte,
whom every one venerates and loves; and those whom he
loves and esteems ought to be respected by every one!"</p>

<p>These simple words effectually imposed silence on the
crowd. The curé of Bouqueval was looked upon throughout
his district almost as a saint, and many there present
were well aware of the interest he took in the
Goualeuse. Still a confused murmur went on, and
Madame Georges, fully comprehending its import,
added:</p>

<p>"Suppose this poor girl were the very worst of creatures&mdash;the
most abandoned of her sex&mdash;your conduct
is not the less disgraceful! What offence has she committed?
And what right have you to punish her?&mdash;you,
who call yourselves men, to exert your strength
and power against one poor, feeble, unresisting female!
Surely it was a cowardly action all to unite against a
defenceless girl! Come, Marie! come, child of my
heart! let us return home; there, at least, you are
known, and justly appreciated."</p>

<p>Madame Georges took the arm of Fleur-de-Marie,
while the labourers, ashamed of their conduct, the impropriety
of which they now perceived, respectfully dispersed.
The widow alone remained; and, advancing
boldly to Madame Georges, she said, in a resolute tone:</p>

<p>"I don't care for a word you say; and, as for this
girl, she does not quit this place until after she has
deposed before the mayor as to all she knows of my
poor husband's murder."</p>

<p>"My good woman!" said Madame Georges, restraining
herself by a violent effort, "my daughter has no
deposition to make here, but, at any future period that
justice may require her testimony let her be summoned,
and she shall attend with myself; until then no person
has a right to question her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, madame, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame Georges prevented the milk-woman from proceeding
by replying, in a severe tone:</p>

<p>"The severe affliction you have experienced can
scarcely excuse your conduct, and you will one day
regret the violence you have so improperly excited. Mlle.
Marie lives with me at the Bouqueval farm; inform the
judge who received your deposition of that circumstance,
and say that we await his further orders."</p>

<p>The widow, unable to argue against words so temperately
and wisely spoken, seated herself on the parapet of
the drinking-place, and, embracing her children, began
to weep bitterly. Almost immediately after this scene
Pierre brought the chaise, into which Madame Georges
and Fleur-de-Marie mounted, to return to Bouqueval.</p>

<p>As they passed before the farmhouse of Arnouville,
the Goualeuse perceived Clara, who had hid herself behind
a partly closed shutter, weeping bitterly. She was
evidently watching for a last glimpse of her friend, to
whom she waved her handkerchief in token of farewell.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame! what shame to me, and vexation to
you, has arisen this morning from our visit to Arnouville!"
said Fleur-de-Marie to her adopted parent, when
they found themselves in the sitting-room at Bouqueval;
"you have probably quarrelled for ever with Madame
Dubreuil, and all on my account! Oh, I foresaw something
terrible was about to happen! God has justly punished
me for deceiving that good lady and her daughter!
I am the unfortunate cause of perpetual disunion between
yourself and your friend."</p>

<p>"My dear child, my friend is a warm-hearted, excellent
woman, but rather weak; still I know her too well
not to feel certain that by to-morrow she will regret her
foolish violence of to-day."</p>

<p>"Alas! madame, think not that I wish to take her
part in preference to yours. No, God forbid! but pardon
me if I say that I fear your great kindness towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
me has induced you to shut your eyes to&mdash;Put yourself
in the place of Madame Dubreuil&mdash;to be told that
the companion of your darling daughter was&mdash;what I
was&mdash;Ah, could any one blame such natural indignation?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately Madame Georges could not find any
satisfactory reply to this question of Fleur-de-Marie's,
who continued with much excitement:</p>

<p>"Soon will the degrading scene of yesterday be in
everybody's mouth! I fear not for myself, but who
can tell how far it may affect the reputation of Mlle.
Clara? Who can answer for it that I may not have tarnished
her fair fame for ever? for did she not, in the
face of the assembled crowd, persist in calling me her
friend&mdash;her sister? I ought to have obeyed my first
impulse, and resisted the affection which attracted me
towards Mlle. Dubreuil, and, at the risk of incurring
her dislike, have refused the friendship she offered me.
But I forgot the distance which separated me from
her, and now, as you perceive, I am suffering the just
penalty; I am punished&mdash;oh, how cruelly punished! for
I have perhaps done an irreparable injury to one so virtuous
and so good."</p>

<p>"My child," said Madame Georges, after a brief silence,
"you are wrong to accuse yourself so cruelly.
'Tis true your past life has been guilty&mdash;very highly so;
but are we to reckon as nothing your having, by the sincerity
of your repentance, obtained the protection and
favour of our excellent curé? and was it not under his
auspices and mine you were introduced to Madame Dubreuil?
and did not your own amiable qualities inspire
her with the attachment she so voluntarily professed for
you? was it not she herself who requested you to call
Clara your sister? and, finally, as I told her just now, for
I neither wished nor ought to conceal the whole truth
from her, how could I, certain as I felt of your sincere
repentance&mdash;how could I, by divulging the past, render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
your attempts to reinstate yourself more painful and difficult,
perhaps impossible, by throwing you, in despair of
being again received by the good and virtuous, back
upon the scorn and derision of those who, equally guilty,
equally unfortunate as you have been, would not perhaps
like you have preserved the secret instinct of honour and
virtue? The disclosure made by the woman to-day is
alike to be lamented and feared; but could I, in anticipation
of an almost impossible casualty, sacrifice your
present comfort and future repose?"</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, a convincing proof of the false and
miserable position I must ever hold may be found in the
fact of your being obliged to conceal the past; and that
the mother of Clara despises me for that past; views me
in the same contemptuous light all will henceforward
behold me, for the scene at the farm of Arnouville will
be quickly spread abroad,&mdash;every one will hear of it!
Oh, I shall die with shame! never again can I meet the
looks of any human being!"</p>

<p>"Not even mine, my child?" said Madame Georges,
bursting into tears, and opening her arms to Fleur-de-Marie,
"you will never find in my heart any other feeling
than the devoted tenderness of a mother. Courage,
then, dear Marie! console yourself with the knowledge
of your hearty and sincere repentance; you are here surrounded
with true and affectionate friends, let this home
be your world. We will anticipate the exposure you
dread so much; our worthy abbé shall assemble the people
about the farm, who all regard you with love and
respect, and he shall tell them the sad history of your
past life; and, trust me, my child, told as the tale
would be by him, whose word is law here, such a disclosure
will but serve to increase the interest all take in
your welfare."</p>

<p>"I would fain think so, dear madame, and I submit
myself. Yesterday, when we were conversing together,
M. le Curé predicted to me that I should be called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
painfully to expiate my past offences; I ought not, therefore,
to be astonished at their commencement. He told
me also that my earthly trials would be accepted as
some atonement for the great wrong I have done; I
would fain hope so. Supported through these painful
ordeals by you and my venerable pastor, I will not&mdash;I
ought not to complain."</p>

<p>"You will go to his presence ere long, and never will
his counsels have been more valuable to you. It is
already half-past four; prepare yourself for your visit
to the rectory, my child. I shall employ myself in
writing to M. Rodolph an account of what occurred at
the farm at Arnouville, and send my letter off by
express; I will then join you at our venerable abbé's,
for it is most important we should talk over matters
together."</p>

<p>Shortly after the Goualeuse quitted the farm in
order to repair to the rectory by the hollow road,
where the old woman, the Schoolmaster, and Tortillard
had agreed to meet.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>As may have been perceived in her conversations
with Madame Georges and the curé of Bouqueval, Fleur-de-Marie
had so nobly profited by the example of her
benefactors, so assimilated herself with their principles,
that, remembering her past degradation, she daily became
more hopeless of recovering the place she had lost
in society. As her mind expanded so did her fine and
noble instincts arrive at mature growth, and bring forth
worthy fruits in the midst of the atmosphere of honour
and purity in which she lived. Had she possessed a
less exalted mind, a less exquisite sensibility, or an
imagination of weaker quality, Fleur-de-Marie might
easily have been comforted and consoled; but, unfortunately,
not a single day passed in which she did not
recall, and almost live over again, with an agony of
horror and disgust, the disgraceful miseries of her past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
life. Let the reader figure to himself a young creature
of sixteen, candid and pure, and rejoicing in that very
candour and purity, thrown, by frightful circumstances,
into the infamous den of the ogress, and irrecoverably
subjected to the dominion of such a fiend,&mdash;such was
the reaction of the past on the present on Fleur-de-Marie's
mind. Let us still further display the resentful
retrospect, or, rather, the moral agony with which the
Goualeuse suffered so excruciatingly, by saying that she
regretted, more frequently than she had courage to own
to the curé, the not having perished in the midst of the
slough of wickedness by which she was encompassed.</p>

<p>However little a person may reflect, or however limited
his knowledge of life may be, he will not refuse to
assent to our remarks touching the commiseration which
such a case as Fleur-de-Marie's fully called for. She
was deserving of both interest and pity, not only because
she had never known what it was to have her affections
fairly roused, but because all her senses were torpid,
and as yet unawakened by noble impulses&mdash;untaught,
unaided, unadvised. Is it not wonderful that this unfortunate
girl, thrown at the tender age of sixteen years in
the midst of the herd of savage and demoralised beings
who infest the Cité, should have viewed her degrading
position with horror and disgust, and have escaped from
the sink of iniquity morally pure and free from sin?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h5>THE HOLLOW WAY.</h5>


<p>The sun was descending, and the fields were silent
and deserted. Fleur-de-Marie had reached the entrance
to the hollow way, which it was necessary to cross in
her walk to the rectory, when she saw a little lame lad,
dressed in a gray blouse and blue cap, come out of the
ravine. He appeared in tears, and directly he saw the
Goualeuse he ran towards her.</p>

<p>"Oh, good lady, have pity on me, I pray!" he exclaimed,
clasping his hands with a supplicating look.</p>

<p>"What do you want? What is the matter with you,
my poor boy?" said the Goualeuse, with an air of
interest.</p>

<p>"Alas, good lady! my poor grandmother, who is
very, very old, has fallen down in trying to climb up the
ravine, and hurt herself very much. I am afraid she
has broken her leg, and I am too weak to lift her up
myself. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> what shall I do if you will not
come and help me? Perhaps my poor grandmother will
die!"</p>

<p>The Goualeuse, touched with the grief of the little
cripple, replied:</p>

<p>"I am not very strong myself, my child; but perhaps
I can help you to assist your poor grandmother. Let us
go to her as quickly as we can! I live at the farm
close by here; and, if the poor old woman cannot walk
there with us, I will send somebody to help her!"</p>

<p>"Oh, good lady, <i>le bon Dieu</i> will bless you for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
kindness! It is close by here&mdash;not two steps down
this hollow way, as I told you. It was in going down
the slope that she fell."</p>

<p>"You do not belong to this part of the country?"
said the Goualeuse, inquiringly following Tortillard,
whom our readers have, no doubt, recognised.</p>

<p>"No, good lady, we came from Ecouen."</p>

<p>"And where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To a good clergyman's, who lives on the hill out
there," said Bras Rouge's son, to increase Fleur-de-Marie's
confidence.</p>

<p>"To the Abbé Laport's, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good lady; to the Abbé Laport's. My poor
grandmother knows him very, very well."</p>

<p>"And I was going there also. How strange that we
should meet," said Fleur-de-Marie, advancing still farther
into the hollow way.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, I'm coming, I'm coming! Take
courage, and I will bring you help!" cried Tortillard, to
forewarn the Schoolmaster and the Chouette to prepare
themselves to lay hands on their victim.</p>

<p>"Your grandmother, then, did not fall down far off
from here?" inquired the Goualeuse.</p>

<p>"No, good lady; behind that large tree there, where
the road turns, about twenty paces from here."</p>

<p>Suddenly Tortillard stopped.</p>

<p>The noise of a horse galloping was heard in the silence
of the place.</p>

<p>"All is lost again!" said Tortillard to himself.</p>

<p>The road made a very sudden bend a few yards from
the spot where Bras Rouge's son was with the Goualeuse.
A horseman appeared at the angle, and when he
came nigh to the young girl he stopped. And then was
heard the trot of another horse; and some moments
after there followed a groom in a brown coat with silver
buttons, white leather breeches, and top-boots. A
leathern belt secured around his waist his master's macintosh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
His master was dressed simply in a stout brown
frock-coat, and a pair of light gray trousers, which fitted
closely. He was mounted on a thoroughbred and splendid
bay horse, which he sat admirably, and which, in
spite of the fast gallop, had not a bead of sweat on his
skin, which was as bright and brilliant as a star. The
groom's gray horse, which stood motionless a few paces
behind his master, was also well-bred and perfect of his
kind. In the handsome dark face of the gentleman
Tortillard recognised the Vicomte de Saint-Rémy, who
was supposed to be the lover of the Duchesse de Lucenay.</p>

<p>"My pretty lass," said the viscount to the Goualeuse,
whose lovely countenance struck him, "would you be so
obliging as to tell me the way to the village of Arnouville?"</p>

<p>Fleur-de-Marie's eyes sunk before the bold and admiring
look of the young man, as she replied:</p>

<p>"On leaving the sunken road, sir, you must take the
first turning to the right, and that path will lead you to
an avenue of cherry-trees, which is the straight road to
Arnouville."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, my pretty lass! You tell me
better than an old woman, whom I found a few yards
further on stretched under a tree, for I could only get
groans and moans out of her."</p>

<p>"My poor grandmother!" said Tortillard, in a whining
tone.</p>

<p>"One word more," said M. de Saint-Rémy, addressing
La Goualeuse. "Can you tell me if I shall easily find
M. Dubreuil's farm at Arnouville?"</p>

<p>Goualeuse could not prevent a shudder at these words,
which recalled to her the painful scene of the morning.
She replied:</p>

<p>"The farm-buildings border the avenue which you
must enter to reach Arnouville, sir."</p>

<p>"Once more, many thanks, my pretty dear," said M.
de Saint-Rémy; and he galloped off with his groom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The handsome features of the viscount were in full
animation whilst he was talking to Fleur-de-Marie, but
when he was again alone they became darkened and
contracted by painful uneasiness. Fleur-de-Marie, remembering
the unknown person for whom they were so
hastily preparing a pavilion at the farm of Arnouville
by Madame de Lucenay's orders, felt convinced it was
for this young and good-looking cavalier.</p>

<p>The sound of the horses' feet as they galloped on was
heard for some time on the hard and frozen ground,
and by degrees grew fainter, then were no longer heard,
and all was once more hushed in silence. Tortillard
breathed again. Desirous of encouraging and warning
his accomplices, one of whom, the Schoolmaster, was
concealed from the horsemen, Bras Rouge's son called
out:</p>

<p>"Granny! granny! here I am! with the good lady
who is coming to help you!"</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, my boy! The gentleman on horseback
has made us lose some time," said the Goualeuse,
walking at a quicker pace, that she might reach the
turning into the hollow way.</p>

<p>She had scarcely entered it when the Chouette, who
was hidden there, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now then, <i>fourline!</i>"</p>

<p>Then springing upon the Goualeuse, the one-eyed hag
seized her by the neck with one hand, whilst with the
other she pressed her mouth; and Tortillard, throwing
himself at the young girl's feet, clung round her legs,
that she might not be able to stir.</p>

<p>This took place so rapidly that the Chouette had no
time to examine the Goualeuse's features; but during
the few instants it required for the Schoolmaster to quit
the hole in which he was ensconced, to grope his way
along with his cloak, the beldame recognised her old
victim.</p>

<p>"La Pegriotte!" she exclaimed, in great surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Then adding with savage delight, "What, is it you?
Ah, the baker (the devil) sends you! It is your fate,
then, to fall into my clutches! I have my vitriol in the
<i>fiacre</i> now, and your white skin shall have a touch, miss;
for it makes me sick to see your fine lady countenance.
Come, my man, mind she don't bite; and hold her tight
whilst we bundle her up."</p>

<p>The Schoolmaster seized the Goualeuse in his two
powerful hands, and before she could utter a cry the
Chouette threw the cloak over her head, and wrapped
her up in it, tightly and securely. In a moment, Fleur-de-Marie,
tied and enveloped, was without any power to
move or call for assistance.</p>

<p>"Now take up your parcel, <i>fourline</i>," said the
Chouette. "He, he, he! This is not such a load as
the 'black peter' of the woman who was drowned in
the Canal of St. Martin&mdash;-is it, my man?" And as
the brigand shuddered at these words, which reminded
him of his fearful vision, the one-eyed hag resumed,
"Well, well, what ails you, <i>fourline?</i> Why, you seem
frozen! Ever since the morning your teeth chatter as
if you had the ague; and you look in the air as if you
were looking for something there!"</p>

<p>"Vile impostor! He is looking to see the flies," said
Tortillard.</p>

<p>"Come, quick! Haste forward, my man! Up with
Pegriotte! That's it!" said the Chouette, as she saw
the ruffian lift Fleur-de-Marie in his arms as he would
carry a sleeping infant. "Quick to the coach! quick,&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"But who will lead me?" inquired the Schoolmaster,
in a hoarse voice, and securing his light and flexible
burden in his herculean arms.</p>

<p>"Old wise head!&mdash;he thinks of every thing!" said
the Chouette.</p>

<p>Then, lifting aside her shawl, she unfastened a red
pocket-handkerchief which covered her skinny neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and, twisting it into its length, said to the Schoolmaster:</p>

<p>"Open your ivories, and take the end of this 'wipe'
between them. Hold tight! Tortillard will take the
other end in his hand, and you have nothing to do but
to follow him. The good blind man requires a good
dog! Here, brat!"</p>

<p>The cripple cut a caper, and made a sort of low and
odd barking. Then, taking the other end of the handkerchief
in his hand, he led the Schoolmaster in this
way, whilst the Chouette hastened forward to apprise
Barbillon. We have not attempted to paint Fleur-de-Marie's
terror when she found herself in the power of
the Chouette and the Schoolmaster. She felt all her
strength leave her, and could not offer the slightest
resistance.</p>

<p>Some minutes afterwards the Goualeuse was lifted into
the <i>fiacre</i> which Barbillon drove, and although it was
night they closed the window-blinds carefully; and the
three accomplices went, with their almost expiring victim,
towards the plain of St. Denis, where Thomas
Seyton awaited them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h5>CLÉMENCE D'HARVILLE.</h5>


<p>The reader will kindly excuse our having left one of
our heroines in a most critical situation, the <i>dénouement</i>
of which we shall state hereafter.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Rodolph had preserved
Madame d'Harville from an imminent danger, occasioned
by the jealousy of Sarah, who had acquainted
M. d'Harville with the assignation Clémence had so
imprudently granted to M. Charles Robert. Deeply
affected with the scene he had witnessed, the prince
returned directly home after quitting the Rue du
Temple, putting off till the next day the visit he
purposed paying to Mlle. Rigolette and the distressed
family of the unfortunate artisan, of whom we have
spoken, believing them out of the reach of present want,
thanks to the money he had given Madame d'Harville to
convey to them, in order that her pretended charitable
visit to the house might assume a more convincing
appearance in the eyes of her husband.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Rodolph was ignorant of Tortillard's
having possessed himself of the purse, although the
reader has already been told how the artful young thief
contrived to effect the barefaced cheat.</p>

<p>About four o'clock the prince received the following
letter, which was brought by an old woman, who went
away the instant she had delivered it without awaiting
any answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">"I owe you more than life; and I would fain express my
heartfelt gratitude for the invaluable service you have rendered
me to-day. To-morrow shame would, perhaps, close my lips. If
your royal highness will honour me with a call this evening, you
will finish the day as you began it&mdash;by a generous action.</p>

<p class="sigs">"<span class="smcap">D'Orbigny d'Harville</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"P.S. Do not, my lord, take the trouble to write an answer.
I shall be at home all the evening."</p>
</div>

<p>However rejoiced Rodolph felt at having been the
happy instrument of good to Madame d'Harville, he
yet could not help regretting the sort of a forced intimacy
which this circumstance all at once established
between himself and the marquise. Deeply struck with
the graceful vivacity and extreme beauty of Clémence,
yet wholly incapable of infringing upon the friendship
which existed between himself and the marquis,
Rodolph, directly he became aware of the passion
which was springing up in his heart for the wife of
his friend, almost denied himself (after having previously
devoted a whole month to the most assiduous
attentions) the pleasure of beholding her. And now,
too, he recollected with much emotion the conversation
he had overheard at the embassy between Tom and
Sarah, when the latter, by way of accounting for her
hatred and jealousy, had affirmed, and not without
truth, that Madame d'Harville still felt, even unknown
to herself, a serious affection for Rodolph.</p>

<p>Sarah was too acute, too penetrating, too well versed
in the knowledge of the human heart, not to be well aware
that Clémence, believing herself scorned by a man who
had made so deep an impression on her heart, and yielding,
from the effects of her irritated feelings, to the
importunities of a perfidious friend, might be induced
to interest herself in the imaginary woes of M. Charles
Robert, without, consequently, forgetting Rodolph.
Other women, faithful to the memory of a man they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
had once distinguished, would have remained indifferent
to the melancholy looks of the commandant.
Clémence d'Harville was therefore doubly blamable,
although she had only yielded to the seduction of unhappiness,
and, fortunately for her, had been preserved
alike by a keen sense of duty and the remembrance of
the prince (which still lurked in her heart, and kept
faithful watch over it) from the commission of an
irreparable fault.</p>

<p>A thousand contradictory emotions disturbed the
mind of Rodolph, as he thought of his interview with
Madame d'Harville. Firmly resolved to resist the
predilection which attracted him to her society, sometimes
he congratulated himself on being able to cast
off his love for her by the recollection of her having
entangled herself with such a being as Charles Robert;
and the next instant he bitterly deplored seeing the
flattering veil with which he had invested his idol fall
to the ground.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Clémence d'Harville, on her part, awaited the approaching
interview with much anxiety; but the two
prevailing sentiments which pervaded her breast were
painful confusion, when she remembered the interference
of Rodolph, and a fixed aversion when she thought
of M. Charles Robert, and many reasons were concerned
in this feeling of dislike almost approaching
hatred itself. A woman will risk her honour or her
life for a man, but she will never pardon him for having
placed her in a mortifying or a ridiculous situation.</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville felt her cheeks flush, and her
pulse beat rapidly as she indignantly recalled the
insulting looks and impertinent remarks of Madame
Pipelet. Nor was this all. After receiving from
Rodolph an intimation of the danger she was incurring,
Clémence had proceeded rapidly towards the fifth
floor, as directed, but the position of the staircase was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
such that, as she hurried on, she perceived M. Charles
Robert in his dazzling <i>robe de chambre</i>, at the very instant
when, recognising the light step of the woman he
expected, he, with a self-satisfied, confident, and triumphant
look, set the door of his apartment half open.
The air of insolent familiarity, expressed by the <i>negligée</i>
toilet he had assumed, quickly enabled the marquise
to perceive how entirely she had been mistaken in his
character. Led away by the kindness and goodness of
her heart, and the generosity of her disposition, to take
a step which might for ever destroy her reputation, she
had accorded this meeting, not from love, but solely
from commiseration, in order to console him for the
ridiculous part the bad taste of the Duke de Lucenay
had made him play before her at the embassy. Words
can ill describe the disgust and vexation with which
Madame d'Harville beheld the slipshod <i>déshabillé</i> of the
commandant, implying as it did his opinion how completely
her ill-judged condescension had broken down
the barriers of etiquette, and led him to consider no
further respect towards her necessary.</p>

<p>The timepiece in the small salon which Madame
d'Harville ordinarily occupied struck nine o'clock.
Dressmakers and tavern-keepers have so much abused
the style of Louis XV. and the Renaissance, that the
marquise, a woman of infinite taste, had excluded from
her apartments this description of ornament, now become
so vulgarised, and confined it to that part of the
hôtel devoted to the reception of visitors and grand
entertainments. Nothing could be more elegant or
more <i>distingué</i> than the fitting-up of the salon in which
the marquise awaited Rodolph. The colour of the walls
as well as the curtains (which, without either valances
or draperies, were of Indian texture) was bright straw
colour, on which were embroidered, in a darker shade,
in unwrought silk, arabesques of the most beautiful designs
and whimsical devices. Double curtains of point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
d'Alençon entirely concealed the windows. The rosewood
doors were set off with gold mouldings, most
beautifully carved, surrounding in each panel an oval
medallion of Sèvres china, nearly a foot in diameter,
representing a numberless variety of birds and flowers
of surpassing brilliancy and beauty. The frames of the
looking-glasses and the cornices of the curtains were
also of rosewood, ornamented with similar raised work
of silver gilt. The white marble mantelpiece, with its
supporting caryatides of antique beauty and exquisite
grace, was from the chisel of the proud and imperious
Marochetti, that great artist having consented to sculpture
this delicious <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> in imitation of Benvenuto
Cellini, who disdained not to model ewers and
armour. Two candelabras, and two candlesticks of
vermeil, forming groups of small figures beautifully
executed, stood on either side of the timepiece, which
was formed of a square block of lapis lazuli raised on
a pedestal of Oriental jasper, and surmounted with a
large and magnificently enamelled golden cup, richly
studded with rubies and pearls, once the property of the
Florentine Republic. Several excellent pictures of the
Venetian school, of middle size, completed this assemblage
of elegance and refined taste.</p>

<p>Thanks to a most charming invention but recently
introduced, this splendid yet simple apartment was
lighted only by the soft rays of a lamp, the unground
surface of whose crystal globe was half hid among a
mass of real flowers, contained in an immensely large
and deep blue and gold Japan cup, suspended from the
ceiling like a lustre by three chains of vermeil, around
which were entwined the green stalks of several climbing
plants; while some of the flexible branches, thickly
laden with flowers, overhanging the edge of the cup and
hanging gracefully down, formed a waving fringe of
fresh verdure, beautifully contrasting with the blue
and gold enamel of the purple porcelain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>We have been thus precise in these details, trifling
as they may seem, in order to give some idea of the
exquisite taste possessed by Madame d'Harville (the
almost invariable companion of an elevated mind), and
also because misfortunes always strike us as more poignantly
cruel when they insinuate themselves into abodes
like this, the favoured possessors of which seem gifted
by Providence with everything to make life happy and
enviable.</p>

<p>Buried in the downy softness of a large armchair,
totally covered by the same straw-coloured Indian silk
as formed the rest of the hangings, Clémence d'Harville
sat, awaiting the arrival of Rodolph. Her hair was
arranged in the most simple manner. She wore a high
dress of black velvet, which well displayed the beauty
and admirable workmanship of her large collar and
cuffs of English lace, which prevented the extreme
black of the velvet from contrasting too harshly with
the dazzling whiteness of her throat and hands.</p>

<p>In proportion as the hour approached for her interview
with Rodolph, the emotion of the marquise increased;
but by degrees her embarrassment ceased, and
firmer resolves took possession of her mind. After a
long and mature reflection she came to the determination
of confiding to Rodolph a great, a cruel secret, hoping
by her frankness to win back that esteem she now
so highly prized. Awakened by gratitude, her pristine
admiration of Rodolph returned with fresh force; one
of those secret whispers, which rarely deceives the heart
that loves, told her that chance alone had not brought
the prince so opportunely to her succour, and that his
studied avoidance of her society during the last few
months had originated in anything but indifference.
A vague suspicion also arose in her mind as to the
reality and sincerity of the affection Sarah professed for
her.</p>

<p>While deeply meditating on all these things, a <i>valet de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
chambre</i>, having first gently tapped at the door, entered,
saying:</p>

<p>"Will it please you, my lady, to see Madame Ashton
and my young lady?"</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville made an affirmative gesture of
assent, and a little girl slowly entered the room.</p>

<p>The child was about four years old, and her countenance
would have been a very charming one but for its
sickly pallor and extreme meagreness. Madame Ashton,
the governess, held her by the hand, but, directly Claire
(that was the name of the little girl) saw her mother,
she opened her arms, and, spite of her feebleness, ran
towards her. Her light brown hair was plaited, and
tied at each side of her forehead with bows of cherry-coloured
riband. Her health was so delicate that she
wore a wrapping-dress of dark brown silk instead of one
of those pretty little white muslin frocks trimmed with
ribands of a similar colour as those in the hair, and well
cut over the bosom to show the plump, pinky arms, and
smooth, fair shoulders, so lovely in healthy children.
So sunken were the cheeks of poor Claire that her large
dark eyes looked quite enormous. But, spite of every
appearance of weakness, a sweet and gentle smile lit up
her small features when she was placed on the lap of
her mother, whom she kissed and embraced with intense
yet mournful affection.</p>

<p>"How has she been of late, Madame Ashton?" inquired
Madame d'Harville of the governess.</p>

<p>"Tolerably well, madame; although at one time I
feared."</p>

<p>"Again!" cried Clémence, pressing her daughter to
her heart with a movement of involuntary horror.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, madame, I was mistaken," said the
governess, "and the whole passed away without any
further alarm; Mademoiselle Claire became composed,
and merely suffered from a momentary feeling of weakness.
She has not slept much this afternoon, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
could not coax her to bed without allowing her the
pleasure of paying a visit to you."</p>

<p>"Dear little angel!" cried Madame d'Harville, covering
her daughter with kisses.</p>

<p>The interesting child repaid her mother's caresses
with infantine delight, when the groom of the chambers
entered and announced:</p>

<p>"His royal highness the Grand Duke of Gerolstein."</p>

<p>Claire, standing on her mother's lap, had thrown her
arms about her neck, and was clasping her with all the
force of which her tiny arms were capable. At the
sight of Rodolph, Clémence blushed deeply, set her child
gently down on the carpet, and signed to Madame Ashton
to take her away; she then rose to receive her guest.</p>

<p>"You must give me leave," said Rodolph, smilingly,
after having respectfully bowed to the marquise, "to
renew my acquaintance with my little friend here, who
I fear has almost forgotten me."</p>

<p>And, stooping down a little, he extended his hand to
Claire, who, first gazing at him with her large eyes, curiously
scrutinised his features, then, recognising him, she
made a gentle inclination of the head, and blew him a
kiss from the tips of her small, thin fingers.</p>

<p>"You remember my lord, then, my child?" asked
Clémence of little Claire, who gave an assenting nod,
and kissed her hand to Rodolph a second time.</p>

<p>"Her health appears to me much improved since I
last saw her," said he, addressing himself with unfeigned
interest to Clémence.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, my lord, she is better, though still
sadly delicate and suffering."</p>

<p>The marquise and the prince, mutually embarrassed
at the thoughts of the approaching interview, would
have been equally glad to defer its commencement,
through the medium of Claire's presence; but, the
discreet Madame Ashton having taken her away,
Rodolph and Clémence were left quite alone.</p>

<p>The armchair in which Madame d'Harville was reclining
stood on the right hand of the chimney, and
Rodolph remained without attempting to seat himself,
gracefully leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece. Never
had Clémence been so strongly impressed with admiration
at the noble and prepossessing appearance of the
prince; never had his voice sounded more gentle or
sweet upon her ear. Fully understanding how painful
it must be to the marquise to open the conversation,
Rodolph at once proceeded to the main point by
observing:</p>

<p>"You have been, madame, the victim of a base and
treacherous action. A cowardly and dishonourable disclosure
on the part of the Countess Macgregor has well-nigh
effected irremediable mischief."</p>

<p>"Is it, indeed, so?" exclaimed Clémence, painfully
surprised; "then my presentiments were not ill-founded!
And by what means did your royal highness discover
this?"</p>

<p>"Last night, at the ball given by the Countess C&mdash;&mdash;,
I discovered this infamous secret. I was sitting in a
lone part of the 'Winter Garden,' when Countess Sarah
and her brother, unconscious that a mass of verdure
alone concealed me from them, while it enabled
me to hear each word they spoke, began conversing
freely upon their own projects, and the snare they had
spread for you. Anxious to warn you of the danger
with which you were threatened, I hastened to Madame
de Nerval's ball, hoping to meet you there, but you did
not appear. To write and direct my letter here was to
incur the risk of its falling into the hands of the marquis,
whose suspicions were already aroused by your
treacherous friend; and I therefore preferred awaiting
your arrival in the Rue du Temple, that I might unfold
to you the perfidy of Countess Macgregor. Let me hope
you will pardon my thus long dwelling on a subject
which must be so painful to you. And, but for the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
lines you were kind enough to write, never would my
lips have in any way reverted to it."</p>

<p>After a momentary silence, Madame d'Harville said
to Rodolph:</p>

<p>"There is but one way, my lord, in which I can prove
to you my gratitude for your late generous conduct.
It is to confess to you that which I have never revealed
to a human being. What I have to say will
not exculpate me in your estimation, but it will,
perhaps, enable you to make some allowances for my
imprudence."</p>

<p>"Candidly speaking, madame," said Rodolph, smiling,
"my position as regards you is a very embarrassing one."</p>

<p>Clémence, astonished at the almost jesting tone in
which he spoke, looked at Rodolph with extreme surprise,
while she said, "How so, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to a circumstance you are doubtless acquainted
with, I am obliged to assume the grave airs
of a mentor touching an incident which, since you have
so happily escaped the vile snare laid for you by Countess
Sarah, scarcely merits being treated with so much
importance. But," continued Rodolph with a slight
shade of gentle and affectionate earnestness, "your
husband and myself are almost as brothers; and, before
our time, our fathers had vowed the sincerest friendship
for each other. I have, therefore, a double motive
in most warmly congratulating you on having secured the
peace and happiness of your husband!"</p>

<p>"And it is from my knowledge of the high regard
and esteem with which you honour M. d'Harville, that
I have determined upon revealing the whole truth, as
well as to explain myself relative to an interest which
must appear to you as ill-chosen and unworthy as it now
seems to me. I wish also to clear up that part of my
conduct which bears an injurious appearance against the
tranquillity and honour of him your highness styles
'almost a brother.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Believe me, madame, I shall at all times be most
proud and happy to receive the smallest proof of your
confidence. Yet permit me to say, as regards the interest
you speak of, that I am perfectly aware it originated
as much in sincere pity as from the constant importunities
of Countess Sarah Macgregor, who had her own
reasons for seeking to injure you. And I also know
equally well that you long hesitated ere you could make
up your mind to take the step you now so much regret."</p>

<p>Clémence looked at the prince with surprise.</p>

<p>"You seem astonished. Well, that you may not
fancy I dabble in witchcraft, some of these days I will
tell you all about it," said Rodolph, smiling. "But your
husband is perfectly tranquillised, is he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," said Clémence, looking down in
much confusion; "and it is most painful to me to hear
him asking my pardon for having ever suspected me,
and then eulogising my modest silence respecting my
good deeds."</p>

<p>"Nay, do not chide an illusion which renders him so
happy. On the contrary, endeavour to maintain the innocent
deception. Were it not forbidden to treat your
late adventure lightly, and had not you, madame, been
so much involved in it, I would say that a woman never
appears more charming in the eyes of her husband than
when she has some fault to conceal. It is inconceivable
how many little cajoleries, and what winning smiles,
are employed to ease a troubled conscience. When I
was young," added Rodolph, smiling, "I always, in spite
of myself, mistrusted any unusual marks of tenderness.
And, by the same rule, I can say of myself, that I never
felt more disposed to appear in an amiable light than
when I was conscious of requiring forgiveness. So,
directly I perceived a more than ordinary anxiety to
please and gratify me, I was very sure (judging by my
own conduct) to ascribe it to some little peccadillo that
needed overlooking and pardoning."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The light tone with which Rodolph continued to
discuss an affair which might have been attended with
circumstances so fearful, at first excited Madame
d'Harville's wonder; but she quickly perceived that the
prince, beneath his outward appearance of trifling,
sought to conceal, or at least lessen, the importance
of the service he had rendered her. And, profoundly
touched with his delicacy, she said:</p>

<p>"I comprehend your generous meaning, my lord;
and you are fully at liberty to jest and forget as much
as you like the peril from which you have preserved me.
But that which I have to relate to you is of so grave, so
serious, and mournful a nature, is so closely connected
with the events of this morning, and your advice may
so greatly benefit me, that I beseech you to remember
that to you I owe both my honour and my life: yes, my
lord, my life! My husband was armed; and he has
owned, in the excess of his repentance, that it was his
intention to have killed me, had his suspicions proved
correct."</p>

<p>"Great God!" exclaimed Rodolph with emotion.</p>

<p>"And he would have been justified in so doing," rejoined
Madame d'Harville, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I beseech you, madame," said Rodolph,&mdash;and this
time he spoke with deep seriousness,&mdash;"I beseech you
to be assured I am incapable of being careless or indifferent
to any matter in which you are concerned.
If I seemed but now to jest, it was but to make you
think less of a circumstance which has already occasioned
you so much pain. But now, madame, you may
command my most solemn attention. Since you honour
me by saying my advice may be useful, I listen most
anxiously and eagerly."</p>

<p>"You can, indeed, counsel me most beneficially, my
lord. But, before I explain to you my reasons for
seeking your aid, I must say a few words concerning
a period of which you are ignorant,&mdash;I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the years which preceded my marriage with M. d'Harville."</p>

<p>Rodolph bowed, and Clémence continued:</p>

<p>"At sixteen years of age I lost my mother (and here
a tear stole down the fair cheek of Madame d'Harville).
I cannot attempt to describe how much I adored that
beloved parent. Imagine, my lord, the very personification
of all earthly goodness. Her fondness for me was
excessive, and appeared her only consolation amid the
many bitter sorrows she had to endure. Caring but
little for what is styled the world, with delicate health,
and a natural predilection for sedentary occupation, her
great delight had been in attending solely to my education,
and her ample store of solid and varied knowledge
well fitted her for the task. Conceive, my lord, her astonishment
and mine when, in my sixteenth year, my
dear preceptress considered my education nearly completed,
my father&mdash;making the feeble health of my
mother a pretext&mdash;announced to us that a young and
accomplished widow, whose misfortunes rendered her
justly interesting, would henceforth be charged with
finishing what my dear parent had begun. My mother
at first resolutely refused obedience to my father's command,
while I in vain besought him not to interpose a
stranger's authority between myself and my beloved
mother. He was inexorable alike to our tears and
prayers, and Madame Roland, who stated herself to be
the widow of a colonel who had died in India, came to
take up her abode with us, in the character of governess
to myself."</p>

<p>"What! the same Madame Roland your father
married almost immediately after the death of your
mother?"</p>

<p>"The same, my lord."</p>

<p>"Was she, then, very beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Tolerably so,&mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>"Clever,&mdash;witty, perhaps?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was a clever dissembler,&mdash;a skilful man&oelig;uvrer;
her talent went no higher. She might be about
five and twenty years of age, with extremely light hair
and nearly white eyelashes; her eyes were large, round,
and a clear blue; the expression of her countenance was
humble and gentle; and while her outward manner was
attentive, even to servility, her real disposition was as
perfidious as it was unfeeling."</p>

<p>"And what were her acquirements?"</p>

<p>"Positively none at all, my lord; and I cannot conceive
how my father, who until then had been so completely
a slave to the dictates of worldly propriety, did
not reflect that the utter incapacity of this woman must
shamefully proclaim the real cause of her being in the
house. My mother earnestly pointed out to him the
extreme ignorance of Madame Roland; he, however,
merely replied, in a tone which admitted of no further
argument, that, competent or otherwise, the young and
interesting widow should retain the situation in his establishment
in which he had placed her. This I heard
subsequently. From that instant my poor mother
comprehended the whole affair, over which she deeply
grieved; regretting less, I fancy, her husband's infidelity
than the domestic unhappiness which would result from
so indecorous a <i>liaison</i>, the account of which she feared
might reach my ears."</p>

<p>"But, even so far as his foolish passion was concerned,
it seems to me that your father acted very unwisely in
introducing this woman into his house."</p>

<p>"And you would be still more at a loss to understand
his conduct if you had but known the extreme formality
and circumspection of his character. Nothing could ever
have induced him thus to trample under foot all the established
rules of society but the unbounded influence of
Madame Roland,&mdash;an influence she exercised with so
much the more certainty as she veiled her designs under
the mask of the most passionate love for him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what was your father's age then?"</p>

<p>"About sixty."</p>

<p>"And he really credited the professions of love made
by so much younger a woman?"</p>

<p>"My father had been in his time one of the most
fashionable and admired men of the day. And Madame
Roland, either following the suggestions of her own artful
mind or urged on by the counsels of others, who
could countenance much more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Counsel such a person!"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, my lord. Imagining that a man
whose reputation for gallantry had always stood high
in the world would, as he advanced in years, be more
easily delighted than another by being flattered upon
his personal advantages, and more credulously receive
such compliments as served to recall those days most
soothing to his vanity to remember, well, my lord, incredible
as it may appear, this woman began to flatter
my poor misguided father upon the graceful <i>tournure</i>
of his features and the inimitable elegance of his shape.
And he in his sixtieth year! Strange as you may
consider it, spite of the excellent sense with which my
father was endowed, he fell blindly into the snare, coarse
and vulgar as it was. Such was&mdash;such still is, I doubt
not&mdash;the secret of the unbounded influence this woman
obtained over him. And really, my lord, spite of my
present disinclination for mirth, I can scarcely restrain
a smile at the recollection of having frequently, before
my marriage, heard Madame Roland assert and maintain
that what she styled real maturity was the finest
portion of a person's existence, and that this maturity
never began until about the fifty-fifth or sixtieth year of
one's age."</p>

<p>"I suppose that happened to be your father's
age?"</p>

<p>"Precisely so, my lord! Then, and then only,
according to Madame Roland, had the understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
combined with experience, attained their full development;
then only could a man, occupying a distinguished
position in the world, enjoy the consideration
to which he was entitled; at that period only were the
<i>tout ensemble</i> of his countenance, and the exquisite grace
of his manners, in their highest perfection; the physiognomy
offering at this delightful epoch of a man's life a
heavenly mixture of winning serenity and gentle gravity.
Then the slight tinge of melancholy, caused by the
many recollections of the past deceit experience is fain
to look back upon, completes the irresistible charm of
real maturity; unappreciable (Madame Roland hastily
added) except by women with head and heart sufficiently
good to despise the youthful frivolity of a poor, inexperienced
forty years, when the character and countenance
can scarcely be called formed, and when good taste
turns away from the boyish folly of such an immature
season of life, and seeks the fine, majestic features impressed
with the sublime and poetic expression resulting
from a sixty years' study of the vast book of human
existence."</p>

<p>Rodolph could not restrain smiling at the powerful
irony with which Madame d'Harville sketched the portrait
of her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," said he to the marquise, "for
which I cannot forgive ridiculous people."</p>

<p>"What is that, my lord?"</p>

<p>"The being also wicked; which prevents our being
able to laugh at them as much as they deserve."</p>

<p>"They probably calculate upon that available advantage,"
replied Clémence.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is very probable, though equally lamentable,
for, if it were not for the recollection of all the
pain Madame Roland has occasioned you, I could be
highly diverted with her system of real maturity as
opposed to the insipidity of mere boys of only forty
years of age, who, according to her assertion, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
scarcely out of their leading-strings, as our grandfathers
and grandmothers would say."</p>

<p>"What principally excited my aversion for her was
the shamefulness of her conduct towards my dear
mother, and the unfortunately over-zealous part she
took in my marriage," said the marquise, after a moment's
pause.</p>

<p>Rodolph looked at her with much surprise.</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord," said Clémence, in a firm, though
gentle tone, "I well remember that M. d'Harville is
your friend and my husband. I know perfectly the
grave importance of the words I have just uttered:
hereafter you yourself shall admit the justice of them.
But to return to Madame Roland, who was now, spite
of her acknowledged incapacity, established as my instructress:
my mother had a long and most painful
altercation with my father on the subject, which drew
down on us his extreme displeasure, and from that
period my mother and myself remained secluded in
our apartments, while Madame Roland, in quality of
my governess, directed the whole household, and almost
publicly did the honours of the mansion."</p>

<p>"What must your mother have suffered!"</p>

<p>"She did, indeed, my lord; but her sorrow was less
for herself than me, whose future destiny might be so
deeply affected by the introduction of this woman.
Her health, always delicate, became daily weaker, and
she fell seriously ill. It chanced, most unfortunately,
that our family doctor, M. Sorbier, in whom she had
the highest confidence, died about this period, to my
mother's extreme regret. Madame Roland immediately
urged my father to place my mother's case in the hands
of an Italian doctor, a particular friend of her own, and
whom she described as possessing a more than ordinary
skill in the treatment of diseases. Thanks to her importunities,
my father, who had himself consulted him
in trifling maladies, and found no cause to be dissatisfied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
proposed him to my mother, who, alas, raised no
objection. And this man it was who attended upon her
during her last illness."</p>

<p>Tears filled the eyes of Madame d'Harville as she
uttered these words.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed to confess my weakness, my lord,"
added she; "but, for the simple reason of this doctor
having been appointed at the suggestion of Madame
Roland, he inspired me (and at that time without any
cause) with the most involuntary repugnance, and it
was with the most painful misgivings I saw him established
in my mother's confidence. Still, as regarded his
knowledge of his profession, Doctor Polidori&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do I hear?" exclaimed Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Are you indisposed, my lord?" inquired Clémence,
struck with the sudden expression the prince's countenance
had assumed.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Rodolph, as though unconscious of
the presence of Madame d'Harville, "no, I must be
mistaken. Five or six years must have elapsed since
all this occurred, while I am informed that it is not more
than two years since Polidori came to Paris, and then
under a feigned name. He it was I saw yesterday,&mdash;I
am sure of it,&mdash;the quack dentist Bradamanti and
Polidori are one and the same. Still, 'tis singular; two
doctors of the same name,<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;what a strange rencontre!"</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> We must remind the reader that Polidori was a doctor of some eminence
when he undertook the education of Rodolph.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Madame," said Rodolph, turning to Madame d'Harville,
whose astonishment at his preoccupation still increased,
"we will, if you please, compare notes as to
this Italian. What age was he?"</p>

<p>"About fifty."</p>

<p>"And his appearance,&mdash;his countenance?"</p>

<p>"Most sinister. Never shall I forget his clear, piercing,
green eye, and his nose curved like the bill of an
eagle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Tis he,&mdash;'tis he himself!" exclaimed Rodolph.
"And do you think, madame, that the Doctor Polidori
you were describing is still in Paris?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell you, my lord. He quitted Paris
about a year after my father's marriage. A lady of my
acquaintance, who at this period also employed the
Italian as her medical adviser&mdash;this lady, Madame de
Lucenay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Duchess de Lucenay?" interrupted Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. But why this surprise?"</p>

<p>"Permit me to be silent on that subject. But, at the
time of which you speak, what did Madame de Lucenay
tell you of this man?"</p>

<p>"She said that he travelled much after quitting Paris,
and that she often received from him very clever and
amusing letters, descriptive of the various places he
visited. Now I recollect that, about a month ago,
happening to ask Madame de Lucenay whether she had
heard lately from M. Polidori, she replied, with an embarrassed
manner, 'that nothing had been heard of or
concerning him for some time; that no one knew what
had become of him; and that by many he was supposed
to be dead.'"</p>

<p>"Strange, indeed," said Rodolph, recalling the
recent visit of Madame de Lucenay to the charlatan
Bradamanti.</p>

<p>"You know this man, then, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for myself, I do; but let me beseech
you to continue your recital; hereafter I will give you
an insight into the history of this Polidori."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Say, rather, the wretch stained with the most atrocious
crimes."</p>

<p>"Crimes!" cried Madame d'Harville, in alarm; "can
it be possible, the man whom Madame Roland so highly
extolled, and into whose hands my poor mother was delivered,
was guilty of crimes? Alas, my dear parent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
lingered but a very short time after she passed into his
care! Ah, my lord, my presentiments have not deceived
me!"</p>

<p>"Your presentiments?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I was telling you just now of the invincible
antipathy I felt for this man from the circumstance
of his having been introduced among us by Madame
Roland; but I did not tell you all, my lord."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I was fearful lest the bitterness of my own griefs
should make me guilty of injustice towards an innocent
person; but now, my lord, you shall know everything.
My mother had lain dangerously ill about five days; I
had always watched beside her, night as well as day.
One evening, that I felt much oppressed with confinement
and fatigue, I went to breathe the fresh air on the
terrace of the garden: after remaining about a quarter
of an hour, I was returning by a long and obscure
gallery; by a faint light which streamed from the
apartment of Madame Roland I saw M. Polidori quit
the room, accompanied by the mistress of the chamber.
Being in the shadow, they did not perceive me; Madame
Roland spoke some words to the doctor, but in so low a
tone I could not catch them; the doctor's answer was
given in a louder key, and consisted only of these words:
'The day after to-morrow;' and, when Madame Roland
seemed to urge him, still in so low a voice as to prevent
the words reaching me, he replied, with singular emphasis,
'The day after to-morrow, I tell you,&mdash;the day after
to-morrow.'"</p>

<p>"What could those words mean?"</p>

<p>"What did they mean? Alas, alas, my lord, it was
on the Wednesday evening I heard M. Polidori say 'The
day after to-morrow;' on the Friday my mother was a
corpse!"</p>

<p>"Horrible, indeed!"</p>

<p>"After this mournful event I was consigned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
care of a relation, who, forgetful of the afflicted state
of my mind, as well as tender age, told me, without reserve
or consideration of the consequences, what powerful
reasons there were for my hating Madame Roland,
and fully enlightened me as to the ambitious projects
entertained by this woman: full well I could then imagine
all my poor mother must have endured. I thought
my heart would break the first time I again saw my
father, which was upon the occasion of his coming to
fetch me from the house of my relation to take me into
Normandy, where we were to pass the first months of
our mourning. During the journey he informed me,
without the least embarrassment, and as though it had
been the most natural thing in the world, that, out of
regard for himself and me, madame had kindly consented
to take the command of the establishment, and
to act as my guide and friend. On arriving at Aubiers
(so was my father's estate called), the first object we
beheld was Madame Roland, who had established herself
here on the very day of my mother's death. Spite
of her modest, gentle manner, her countenance betrayed
an ill-disguised triumph; never shall I forget the look,
at once ironical and spiteful, she cast on me as I descended
from the carriage; it seemed to say, 'I am
mistress here,&mdash;'tis you who are the intruder.' A
fresh grief awaited me; whether from an inexcusable
want of proper judgment or unpardonable assurance,
this woman occupied the apartment which had been my
mother's: in my just indignation I loudly complained
to my father of this unpleasant forgetfulness of my
rights as well as wishes. He reprimanded me severely
for making any remonstrance on the subject,
adding that it was needless for me either to feel or
express surprise on the subject, as it was his desire I
should habituate myself to consider Madame Roland in
every respect as a second mother, and show her a corresponding
deference. I replied that it would be a profanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
to that sacred name to act as he commanded;
and, to his extreme wrath, I never allowed any opportunity
to escape by which I could evince my deeply
rooted aversion to Madame Roland. At times my
father's rage knew no bounds, and bitterly would he
reproach me in the presence of that woman for the
coldness and ingratitude of my conduct towards an
angel, as he styled her, sent by heaven for our consolation
and happiness. 'Let me entreat of you to speak
for yourself alone,' said I, one day, quite wearied with
the hypocritical conduct of Madame Roland and my
father's blind infatuation. The harshness and unreasonableness
of his conduct became at last quite unendurable;
while Madame Roland, with the honeyed
words of feigned affection, would artfully intercede
for me, because she well knew by so doing she should
only increase the storm she had raised. 'You must
make some allowances for Clémence,' she would say;
'the sorrow she experiences for the excellent parent
we all deplore is so natural, and even praiseworthy,
that you should respect her just grief, and pity her
for her unfounded suspicions.' 'You hear her! you
hear her!' would my father exclaim, pointing with
mingled triumph and admiration to the accomplished
hypocrite; 'what angelic goodness! what enchanting
nobleness and generosity! Instantly entreat her pardon
for the unworthiness of your conduct.' 'Never!'
I used to reply; 'the spirit of my angel mother, who
now beholds me, would be pained to witness such a
degradation in her child;' and, bursting with grief
and mortification, I would fly to my own chamber,
leaving my father to dry the tears, and calm the
ruffled feelings of the woman I despised and hated.
You will, I hope, excuse me, my lord, for dwelling so
long and so minutely on all my early troubles, but it
is only by so doing I can accurately describe to you
the sort of life I led at that period."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can enter fully into the painful subject; yet how
often have the same scenes been enacted in other families,
and still, it is much to be feared, will they be
repeated till the end of time. But in what capacity
did your father introduce Madame Roland to the
neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"As my instructress and his friend, and she was
estimated accordingly."</p>

<p>"I need scarcely inquire whether he shared in the
solitude to which her questionable character condemned
the lady?"</p>

<p>"With the exception of some few and unavoidable
visits, she saw no one. My father, guided by his passion,
or influenced by Madame Roland, threw off his
mourning for my mother ere he had worn it three
months, under the plea that the sable garb continually
reminded him of his loss, and prevented him from regaining
his lost tranquillity. His manners to me daily
became colder and more estranged, while his perfect
indifference concerning me allowed a degree of liberty
almost incredible in a person of my age. I met him
only at breakfast, after which he returned to his study
with Madame Roland, who acted as his secretary, read
and answered all his letters, etc.; that completed,
they either walked or drove out together, returning
only an hour before dinner, against which, Madame
Roland would array herself in an elegant and well-chosen
evening dress; while my father would make
a most studiously elaborate toilet, as uncalled for as ill-adapted
to his time of life. Occasionally, after dinner,
he received a few persons he could not avoid asking
to his house, when he would play at tric-trac with
Madame Roland until ten o'clock, at which hour he
would offer his arm to conduct her to my mother's
apartment, and return to his guests. As for myself,
I had unrestrained permission to go where I pleased
throughout the whole day. Attended by a servant, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
used to take long rides in the extensive woods surrounding
the château, and when, as occasionally happened, I
felt my spirits unequal to appearing at the dinner-table,
not the slightest inquiry was ever made after me, or my
absence noticed."</p>

<p>"What singular neglect and forgetfulness!"</p>

<p>"Having accidentally encountered one of our neighbours
during several successive days of my excursions
in the woods, I gave up riding there, and confined myself
entirely to the park."</p>

<p>"And how did this infamous woman conduct herself
towards you when alone?"</p>

<p>"She shunned all occasions of being with me as
sedulously as I avoided her; but once that we were
unexpectedly <i>tête-à-tête</i> with each other, and that she
was reproaching me for some severe words I had spoken
the preceding evening, she said, coldly, 'Have a care:
you cannot contend against my power; any such attempt
will bring down certain ruin on your head.' 'As it did
upon that of my mother,' answered I. 'It is a pity,
madame, you have not M. Polidori by your side, to announce
to you that your vengeance can be satisfied&mdash;the
day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And what reply did she make when you thus recalled
those fearful words?"</p>

<p>"She changed colour rapidly, her features were almost
convulsed; then, by a strong effort conquering her
emotion, she angrily demanded what I meant by the expression.
'Ask your own heart, madame,' answered I;
'in the solitude of your chamber inquire of yourself to
what I allude: your conscience will find a ready explanation.'
Shortly after that, a scene occurred which for
ever sealed my destiny.</p>

<p>"Among a great number of family portraits, which
graced the walls of the salon in which we usually spent the
evening, was that of my mother. One day I observed it
had been removed from its accustomed place. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
neighbours had dined with us. One of them, a M. Dorval,
a country lawyer, had always expressed the utmost veneration
and respect for my mother. When we reached
the salon after dinner, I inquired of my father what had
become of my dear mother's picture. 'Cease!' cried
my father, significantly pointing to our guests, as though
intimating his desire that they should not hear any discussion
on the subject; 'the reason of the picture being
taken away is that the sight of it continually reminded
me of the heavy loss I have sustained, and so prevented
my regaining my usual calmness and peace of mind.'
'And where is the portrait at present?' inquired I.
Turning towards Madame Roland, with an impatient
and uneasy air, he said, 'Where has the picture been
put?' 'In the lumber-room,' replied she, casting on
me a glance of defiance, evidently under the impression
that the presence of witnesses would prevent me from
proceeding further in the matter. 'I can easily believe,
madame,' cried I, indignantly, 'that the recollection of
my mother must have been painful to you; but that
was not a sufficient reason for banishing from the walls
the likeness of her who, when you were in want and
misery, kindly and charitably afforded you the shelter
of her roof.'"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Rodolph; "yours was, indeed,
a stinging and a just reproach."</p>

<p>"'Mademoiselle,' cried my father, 'you forget that
this lady has watched, and still continues to preside,
with maternal solicitude over your education; you also
seem to banish from your recollection the very high
esteem and respect you are aware I entertain for her;
and, since you allow yourself thus to attack her before
strangers, you will permit me to tell you that, in my
opinion, the charge of ingratitude lies at the door of her
who, overlooking the tender cares she has received, presumes
to reproach a person, deserving of the utmost
interest and respect, with misfortunes and calamities she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
so nobly sustained.' 'I cannot venture to discuss the
subject with you, my dear father,' said I, submissively.
'Perhaps, then, mademoiselle, you will favour me with
your polite arguments in favour of rudeness and unmerited
abuse,' cried Madame Roland, carried away by
rage into a neglect of her usual caution and prudence;
'perhaps you will permit me to assert that, so far from
owing the slightest obligation to your mother, I have
nothing to remember but the constant coldness and
dislike she invariably manifested towards me, fully expressive
of the disgust and displeasure with which my
residence in the house inspired her.' 'Forbear,
madame!' exclaimed I, interrupting her. 'Out of
respect for my father, if not to spare your own
blushes, cease such shameful confessions as the one
you have just made, or you will make even me regret
having exposed you to so humiliating a disclosure.'"</p>

<p>"Better and better!" cried Rodolph; "this was, indeed,
cutting with a two-edged sword. Pray go on.
And what said this woman?"</p>

<p>"By a very hackneyed, though convenient expedient,
Madame Roland contrived to end a scene in which she
felt she was likely to have the worst. With a sudden
cry she threw herself into a chair, and very naturally
imitated a fainting-fit. Thanks to this incident, the two
visitors quitted the room in search of restoratives; while
I retired to my own apartment, leaving my father hanging
in deep anxiety over the wicked cause of all this
confusion."</p>

<p>"Doubtless your next interview with your father
must have been a stormy one."</p>

<p>"He came to me next morning, and, without further
preamble, addressed me as follows: 'In order to prevent
a recurrence of the disgraceful scene of yesterday, I
think proper to inform you, that, immediately that decency
permits both you and myself to throw off our
mourning, it is my intention to celebrate my marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
with Madame Roland, which will compel you to treat
her with the respect and deference due to my wife.
For certain reasons, it is expedient you should marry
before me. You will have as a dowry your mother's
fortune, amounting to more than a million francs.
From this very day, I shall take the necessary steps to
form a suitable match for you, and, for that purpose, I
shall accept one of the many offers I have received for
your hand.' After this conversation, I lived more alone
than ever, never meeting my father except at mealtimes,
which generally passed off in the utmost silence.
So really dull and lonely was my present existence, that
I only waited for my father to propose any suitor he
might approve of, to accept him with perfect willingness.
Madame Roland, having relinquished all further
ill-natured remarks upon the memory of my deceased
parent, indemnified herself by inflicting on me the continual
pain of seeing her appropriate to herself the various
trifles my dear mother had exclusively made use of.
Her easy chair, embroidery-frame, the books which composed
her private library, even a screen I myself had
embroidered for her, and in the centre of which were
our united ciphers: this woman laid her sacrilegious
hands on all the elegant articles with which my
mother's taste and my affection had ornamented her
apartments."</p>

<p>"I can well imagine all the horror these profanations
must have caused you."</p>

<p>"Still, great as were my sufferings, the state of loneliness,
in which I found myself, rendered them even
greater."</p>

<p>"And you had no one, no person in whom you could
confide?"</p>

<p>"No one; but at this time I received a touching
proof of the interest my fate excited, and which might
have opened my eyes to the dangers preparing for me.
One of the two persons present, during the scene with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Madame Roland I so lately described, was a M. Dorval,
a worthy old notary, to whom my mother had rendered
some signal service. By my father's orders, I never
since then entered the salon when strangers were there;
I had never, therefore, seen M. Dorval after the eventful
day when I spoke so undisguisedly to Madame
Roland; great, therefore, was my surprise to see him
coming towards me one day, in the park, while I was
taking my accustomed walk. 'Mademoiselle,' said he
to me, with a mysterious air, 'I am fearful of being
observed by your father; here is a letter,&mdash;read it, and
destroy it immediately,&mdash;its contents are most important
to you.' So saying, he disappeared as quickly as he
came. In the letter he informed me that it was in agitation
to marry me to the Marquis d'Harville, and that
the match appeared in every respect eligible, inasmuch
as every one concurred in bearing testimony to the
many excellent qualities of M. d'Harville, who was
young, rich, good-looking, and highly distinguished for
his talents and mental attainments; yet that the families
of two young ladies, with whom he had been on the
point of marriage, had abruptly broken off the matches.
The notary added that, although entirely ignorant of
the cause of these ruptures, he still considered it his
duty to apprise me of them, without in the slightest
degree insinuating that they originated in any circumstance
prejudicial to the high opinion entertained of M.
d'Harville. The two young ladies alluded to were, one,
the daughter of M. Beauregard, a peer of France; the
other, of Lord Dudley. M. Dorval concluded by saying
that his motive in making the communication was because
my father, in his extreme desire to conclude the
marriage, did not appear to attach sufficient importance
to the facts now detailed."</p>

<p>"Now you recall it to my recollection," said Rodolph,
after some minutes spent in deep meditation on what he
had just heard, "I remember that your husband, at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
of nearly twelve months, told me of two marriages
which had been broken off just as they were on
the point of taking place, and ascribing their abrupt
termination to a difficulty in arranging matters of a
mere pecuniary nature."</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville smiled bitterly as she replied:</p>

<p>"You shall know what those motives really were, my
lord, very shortly. After reading the letter, so kindly
intentioned on the part of the worthy notary, I felt both
my uneasiness and curiosity rapidly increase. Who
was D'Harville? My father had never mentioned him
to me. In vain I ransacked my memory; I could not
recollect ever to have heard the name. Soon, however,
the current of my thoughts was directed into another
channel by the abrupt departure of Madame Roland for
Paris. Although the period of her absence was limited
to eight days at the utmost, yet my father expressed the
deepest grief at even this trifling separation from her.
His temper became altogether soured, and his coldness
towards me hourly increased; he even went so far as to
reply, when one day I inquired after his health, 'I am
ill,&mdash;and all through you.' 'Through me?' exclaimed
I. 'Assuredly, through you; you know full well how
indispensable to my happiness is the company of
Madame Roland, yet this incomparable woman, who
has been so grossly insulted by you, has left me to undertake
her present journey solely on your account.'
This mark of interest on the part of Madame Roland
filled me with the most lively apprehensions of evil, and
a vague presentiment floated across my mind that my
marriage was in some way or other mixed up with it.
I must leave it to your imagination, my lord, to picture
the delight of my father upon the return of my future
mother-in-law. The next day he sent to desire my
company; I found him alone with her. 'I have, for
some time,' said he, 'been thinking of establishing you
in the world; in another month your mourning will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
have expired. To-morrow I expect M. d'Harville, a
young man possessed of every requisite, both as to
fortune and figure, to secure any woman's approbation;
he is well looked upon in society, and is capable of
securing the happiness of any lady he may seek in marriage.
Now, having seen you, though accidentally, his
choice has fallen on you. In fact, he is most anxious to
obtain your hand. Every pecuniary arrangement is concluded.
It therefore remains solely with yourself to be
married ere the next six weeks have elapsed. If, on the
contrary, from any capricious whim impossible for me to
foresee, you think fit to refuse the unlooked-for good
offer now before you, it will in no respect alter my own
plans, as my marriage will take place, according to my
original intention, directly my mourning expires. And,
in this latter case, I am bound to inform you that your
presence in my house will not be agreeable to me, unless
I have your promise to treat my wife with the respect
and tenderness to which she is entitled.' 'I understand
you,' replied I; 'whether I accept M. d'Harville or no,
you will marry; and my only resource will then be to
retire to the Convent of the Holy Heart?' 'It will,'
answered he, coldly."</p>

<p>"His conduct now ceases to be classed under the
term weakness," said Rodolph; "it assumes the form
of positive cruelty."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you, my lord, what has always prevented
me from feeling the least resentment at my father's conduct?
It is because I have always had a strong presentiment
that he would one day pay dearly&mdash;too
dearly, alas!&mdash;for his blind passion for Madame
Roland. Thank Heaven, that evil day has not yet
arrived!"</p>

<p>"And did you not mention to your father what the
old notary had informed you of,&mdash;the abrupt breaking
off of the two marriages M. d'Harville had been on the
point of contracting?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, I did, my lord. I signified to my father,
upon the occasion of the conversation I was relating
to you, a wish to speak with him alone, upon which
Madame Roland abruptly rose and quitted the apartment.
'I have no objection to the union you propose
with M. d'Harville,' said I; 'only, as I understand, he
has twice been upon the point of marriage, and&mdash;'
'Enough&mdash;enough!' interrupted he, hastily. 'I know
all about those two affairs, which were so abruptly
broken off merely because matters of a pecuniary
nature were not satisfactorily arranged; although, I
am bound to assure you, that not the slightest shadow
of blame was attributable to M. d'Harville. If that
be your only objection, you may consider the match
as concluded on, and yourself as married,&mdash;ay, and
happily, too,&mdash;for, spite of your conduct, my first
wish is for your happiness.'"</p>

<p>"No doubt Madame Roland was delighted with your
marriage?"</p>

<p>"Delighted? Yes, my lord," said Clémence, with
bitterness. "She was, and well might be, delighted
with this union, which was, in fact, of her effecting.
She it was who had first suggested it to my father; she
knew full well the real occasion of breaking off the
marriages so nearly completed by M. d'Harville, and
hence arose her exceeding anxiety for him to become
my husband."</p>

<p>"What motive could she possibly have had?"</p>

<p>"She sought to avenge herself on me by condemning
me to a life of wretchedness."</p>

<p>"But your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deceived by Madame Roland, he fully and implicitly
believed that interested motives alone had set aside the
two former marriages of M. d'Harville."</p>

<p>"What a horrible scheme! But what was this mysterious
reason?"</p>

<p>"You shall know shortly. Well, M. d'Harville arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
at Aubiers, and, I confess, I was much pleased
with his appearance, manners, and cultivated mind.
He seemed very amiable and kind, though somewhat
melancholy. I remarked in him a contradiction which
charmed and astonished me at the same time. His
personal and mental advantages were considerable, his
fortune princely, and his birth illustrious; yet, at times,
the expression of his countenance would change, from a
firm and manly energy and decision of purpose, to an almost
timid, shrinking look, as though he feared even his
own self; then an utter dejection of spirits and exhaustion
would ensue. There was, at these strangely contrasted
periods, such a look of deprecating humility, such
an appearance of conscious wrong, as touched me deeply,
and won my pity to a great extent. I admired greatly
the kindness of manner he ever evinced to an old servant,&mdash;a
<i>valet de chambre</i> who had been about him
from his birth, and who alone was suffered to attend
upon his master now he had reached man's estate.
Shortly after M. d'Harville's arrival he remained for
two days secluded in his apartment. My father wished
to visit him; but the old servant alluded to objected,
stating that his master had so violent a headache, he
could receive no one. When M. d'Harville emerged
from his chamber, he was excessively pale, and looked
extremely ill. He afterwards appeared to experience a
sort of impatience and uneasiness when any reference
was made to his temporary indisposition. In proportion
as I became better acquainted with M. d'Harville, I discovered
that, on many points, a singular similarity of
taste existed between us. He had so much to be proud
of, and so many reasons for being happy, that his excessive
and shrinking modesty struck me as something
more than admirable. The day for our marriage being
fixed, he seemed to delight in anticipating every wish
I could form for the future, and, when sometimes I alluded
to the deep melancholy which at times possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
him, and begged to know the cause, he would speak of
his deceased parents, and of the delight it would have
afforded them to see him married, to their hearts' dearest
wish, to one so justly approved both by his own judgment
and affections, I could not well find fault with
reasons so complimentary to myself. M. d'Harville
easily guessed the terms on which I must have been
living with my father and Madame Roland, although
the former, delighted at my marriage, which would
serve as a plea for accelerating his own, had latterly
treated me with excessive tenderness. In some of our
conversations, M. d'Harville, with infinite tact and good
feeling, explained to me that his regard was considerably
heightened by the knowledge of all I had suffered since
my dear mother's death. I thought it my duty to hint
to him, at such a time, that, as my father was about to
marry again, it might very possibly affect the property I
might be expected to inherit. He would not even permit
me to proceed, but most effectually convinced me of
his own utterly disinterested motives in seeking my hand.
I could not but think that the families, who had so
abruptly broken off his former projected alliances, must
have been very unreasonable or avaricious people if they
made pecuniary matters a stumbling-block with one so
generous, easy, and liberal as M. d'Harville."</p>

<p>"And such as you describe him, so have I always
found him," cried Rodolph; "all heart, disinterestedness,
and delicacy! But did you never speak to him of
the marriages so hastily broken off?"</p>

<p>"I will confess to you, my lord, that the question was
several times on my lips; but, when I recollected the
sensitiveness of his nature, I feared to pain him by questions
which might, at any rate, have wounded his self-love,
or taxed his honour to reply to truly. The nearer
the day fixed for our marriage approached, the more delighted
did M. d'Harville appear. Yet I several times
detected him absorbed in the most perfect dejection, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
deepest melancholy. One day, in particular, I caught
his eyes fixed on me with a settled gaze, as though
resolving to confide to me some important secret he yet
could not bring himself to reveal. I perceived a large tear
trickle slowly down his cheek, as though wrung from his
very heart. The recollection of his two former prospects
of marriage, so suddenly destroyed, rose to my mind;
and, I confess, I almost felt afraid to proceed. A vague
presentiment whispered within me that the happiness of
my whole life was at stake,&mdash;perhaps perilled for ever.
But then, on the other hand, such was my eager desire
to quit my father's house, that I turned a deaf ear to
every suggestion of evil arising from my union with
M. d'Harville."</p>

<p>"And did M. d'Harville make you no voluntary confession?"</p>

<p>"Not any. When I inquired the cause of his continual
fits of melancholy, he would answer, 'Pray, do not heed
it! But I am always most sad when most happy.' These
words, pronounced in the kindest and most touching manner,
reassured me a little. And how, indeed, was it possible,
when his voice would quiver with emotion, and his
eyes fill with tears, to manifest any further suspicion, by
repeating my questions as to the past, when it was with
the future only I had any business? The persons appointed
to witness the contract on the part of M. d'Harville,
M. de Lucenay and M. de Saint-Rémy, arrived at
Aubiers some days previous to the marriage; my nearest
relations alone were invited. Immediately after the conclusion
of the ceremony, we were to depart for Paris;
and it is true I felt for M. d'Harville none of that love
with which a young wife ought to regard the man she
vows her future life to, but I admired and respected his
character and disposition, and, but for the disastrous
events which followed this fatal union, a more tender
feeling could doubtless soon have attached me to him.
Well, we were married."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>At these words, Madame d'Harville turned rather pale,
and her resolution appeared to forsake her. After a
pause, she resumed:</p>

<p>"Immediately after the ceremony, my father embraced
me tenderly, as did Madame Roland also. Before so many
persons I could not avoid the display of this fresh exhibition
of hypocrisy. With her dry and white hand she
squeezed mine so hard as to pain me, and said, in a
whisper, and in a tone as gentle as it was perfidious,
these words, which I never can forget: 'Think of me
sometimes in the midst of your bliss, for it was I who
arranged your marriage.' Alas, I was far from comprehending
at that moment the full force of those words!
Our marriage took place at eleven o'clock, and we immediately
entered our carriage, followed by my waiting-woman
and the old <i>valet de chambre</i> of M. d'Harville's,
and we travelled so rapidly that we reached Paris before
ten o'clock in the evening. I should have been surprised
at the silence and melancholy of M. d'Harville had I not
known that he had what he termed his happy sadness.
I was myself painfully disturbed; I was returning to
Paris for the first time since my mother's death; I
arrived there alone with my husband, whom I had
hardly known more than six weeks, and who, up to
the evening before, had not addressed a word to me
but what was marked by respectful formality. Men,
however well bred, do not think sufficiently of the fear
which the sudden change in their tone and manners
occasions to a young female as soon as she belongs to
them; they do not reflect that a youthful maiden cannot
in a few hours forget all her timidity and virgin scruples."</p>

<p>"Nothing is to me more barbarous than this system
of carrying off a young female as soon as the wedding
ceremony is over,&mdash;a ceremony which ought to consecrate
the right and duty to employ still more every tenderness
of love and effort to render mutual affection still
stronger and more endearing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will imagine, monseigneur, the indefinable alarm
with which I found myself in Paris,&mdash;in the city in which
my mother had died hardly a year before. We reached
the Hôtel d'Harville&mdash;"</p>

<p>The emotion of the young lady redoubled, her cheeks
were flushed with scarlet, and she added, in a voice
scarcely intelligible:</p>

<p>"You must know all; if not, I shall appear too contemptible
in your eyes. Well, then," she resumed, with
desperate resolution, "I was led to my apartment and
left there alone; after an hour M. d'Harville joined me
there. I was weeping bitterly. My husband came towards
me, and was about to take my arm, when he fell at my
feet in agony. He could not hear my voice, his countenance
was spasmodic with fearful convulsions, his eyes
rolled in their orbits with a rapidity that appalled me,
his contorted mouth was filled with blood and foam, and
his hand grasped me with inconceivable force. I made
a desperate effort, and his stiffened fingers at length unclasped
from my wrist, and I fainted at the moment
when M. d'Harville was struggling in the paroxysm of
this horrible attack. This was my wedding night, my
lord,&mdash;this was the vengeance of Madame Roland!"</p>

<p>"Unhappy woman!" said Rodolph, overwhelmed. "I
understand,&mdash;an epileptic. Ah, 'tis horrible!"</p>

<p>"And that is not all," added Clémence, in a voice
almost choked by emotion; "my child, my angel girl,
she has inherited this frightful malady."</p>

<p>"Your daughter! She! What? Her paleness&mdash;her
weakness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is, I dread to believe, hereditary; and the physicians
think, therefore, that it is incurable."</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville hid her face in her hands; overcome
by this painful disclosure, she had not courage to
add another word. Rodolph also remained silent. His
mind recoiled affrighted from the terrible mysteries of
this night. He pictured to himself the young maiden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
already sad, in consequence of her return to the city in
which her mother had died, arriving at a strange house,
alone with a man for whom she felt an interest and
esteem, but not love, nor any of those sentiments which
enchant the mind, none of the engrossing feeling which
removes the chaste alarms of a woman in the participation
of a lawful and reciprocal affection. No, no; on
the contrary, Clémence arrived agitated and distressed,
with depressed spirits and tearful eyes. She was, however,
resolved on resignation and the fulfilment of duty,
when, instead of listening to language full of devotion,
love, and tenderness, which would compensate for the
sorrowful feelings which were uppermost in her mind,
she sees convulsed at her feet a stricken man, who
twists, and foams, and shrieks, in the hideous convulsions
of one of the most fearful infirmities with which
a man can be incurably smitten! This is not all: his
child, poor little innocent angel! is also withered from
her birth. These sad and painful avowals excited bitter
reflections in Rodolph's mind. "Such," said he, "is the
law of the land. A young, handsome, and pure girl,
the confiding and gentle victim of a shameful dissimulation,
unites her destiny to that of a man tainted with
an incurable malady,&mdash;a fatal inheritance which he will
assuredly transmit to his children. The unhappy wife
discovers this horrid mystery. What can she do?
Nothing,&mdash;nothing but suffer and weep; nothing but
endeavour to overcome her disgust and fright; nothing
but pass her days in anguish, in indefinable and endless
terror; nothing but seek, perhaps, culpable consolation
without the desolate existence which has been created
around her. Again," said Rodolph, "these strange
laws sometimes produce horrible unions: fearful for
humanity. In these laws, animals always appear superior
to man in the care bestowed upon them; in the
improvements that are studied for them; in the protection
which encircles, the guarantees which attend them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Buy an animal, and, if an infirmity decried by the law
is detected after the purchase, the sale is null and void.
Indeed, what a shame, what a case of public injury
would it be to compel a man to keep an animal which
has a cough, is lame, or has lost an eye! Why, it
would be scandalous, criminal, unheard-of infamy! Only
imagine being compelled to keep, and keep for ever, a
mule with a cough, a horse that was blind, or an ass
that was lame! What frightful consequences might not
such injustice entail on the community! Therefore, no
such bargains hold good, no words bind, no contract is
valid: the omnipotent law unlooses all that was thus
bound. But if it relates to a creature made after God's
own image, if it respects a young girl who, in the full
and innocent reliance on the good faith of a man, unites
her lot with his, and wakes up in the company of an
epileptic, an unhappy wretch stricken with a fearful
malady, whose moral and physical consequences are
immeasurably distressing, a malady which may throw
disorder and aversion into a family, perpetuate a horrible
disease, vitiate whole generations, yes, this law, so
inexorable when lame, blind, or coughing animals are
the consideration&mdash;this law, so singularly clear-sighted,
which will not allow an unsound horse to increase the
species&mdash;this law will not loosen the victim of a union
such as we have described. These bonds are sacred,
indissoluble: it is to offend God and man to break
them. In truth," continued Rodolph, "men sometimes
display a humility most shameful and an egotistical
pride which is only execrable. He values himself at
less than the beast which he protects by warranties
which he refuses for himself; and he imposes on himself,
makes sacred, and perpetuates his most distressing
infirmities by putting them under the protection of the
immutability of laws, human and divine." Rodolph
greatly blamed M. d'Harville, but he promised to himself
to excuse him in the eyes of Clémence, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
fully persuaded, after her sad disclosure, that the marquis
was for ever alienated from her heart. One thought led
to another, and Rodolph said to himself, "I have kept
aloof from a woman I love, and who, perhaps, already
feels a secret inclination for me. Either from an
attachment of heart or friendship, she has bestowed
her honour&mdash;her life&mdash;for the sake of a fool whom
she thought unhappy. If, instead of leaving her, I had
paid her all sorts of attentions, love, and consideration,
my name would have been such that her reputation
would not have received the slightest stain, the suspicions
of her husband would never have been excited:
whilst, now, she is all but at the mercy of such an ass
as M. Charles Robert, who, I fear, will become the more
indiscreet in proportion as he has the less right to be so.
And then, too, who knows if, in spite of the dangers she
has risked, the heart of Madame d'Harville will always
remain free? Any return to her husband is henceforward
impossible. Young, handsome, courted, with a
disposition sympathising with all who suffer, what
dangers, what shoals and quicksands, lie before her!
For M. d'Harville, what anguish and what deep chagrin!
At the same time jealous of and in love with his wife,
who cannot subdue the disgust and fright which he
excited in her on their nuptials,&mdash;what a lot is his!"</p>

<p>Clémence, with her forehead hidden by her hands, her
eyes brimful of tears, and her cheek reddened by embarrassment,
avoided Rodolph's look, such pain had the
disclosure cost her.</p>

<p>"Ah, now," said Rodolph, after a long silence, "I can
understand the cause of M. d'Harville's sadness, which
I could not before account for. I can imagine his
regrets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His regrets!" exclaimed Clémence; "say his remorse,
monseigneur, if he have any, for never was such
a crime more coolly meditated."</p>

<p>"A crime, madame?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"What else is it, my lord, to bind to yourself in
indissoluble bonds a young girl, who confides in your
honour, when you are fatally stricken with a malady
which inspires fear and horror? What else is it, to
devote with certainty an unhappy child to similar
misery? What forced M. d'Harville to make two victims?
A blind, insensate passion? No; he found my
birth, my fortune, and my person, to his taste. He
wished to make a convenient marriage, because, doubtless,
a bachelor's life wearied him."</p>

<p>"Madame, at least pity him."</p>

<p>"Pity him? If you wish pity, pray let it be bestowed
on my child. Poor victim of this odious union, what
nights and days have I passed near her! What tears
have not her misfortunes wrung from me!"</p>

<p>"But her father suffers from the same unmerited
afflictions."</p>

<p>"Yet it is that father who has condemned her to a
sickly infancy, a withering youth, and, if she should
survive, to a life of isolation and misery, for she will
never marry. Ah, no! I love her too well to expose
her to the chance of one day's weeping over her own
offspring, similarly smitten, as I weep over her. I have
suffered too much from treachery, to render myself
guilty of, or an accomplice in, such wickedness!"</p>

<p>"You are right; the vengeance of your mother-in-law
was really atrocious. But patience, and perhaps in your
turn you will be avenged," said Rodolph, after a moment's
reflection.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my lord?" inquired Clémence,
astonished at the change in his voice.</p>

<p>"I have generally had the satisfaction of seeing those
whom I have known to be wicked most severely punished,"
he replied, in a voice that made Clémence shudder.
"But the day after this unhappy event what did
your husband say?"</p>

<p>"He confessed, with singular candour, that his two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
former marriages had been broken off in consequence of
the families becoming acquainted with the secret of his
fearful malady. Thus, then, after having been twice
rejected, he had the shameful, the unmanly courage, to
drag a third poor victim into the abyss of misery the
kind intervention of friends had preserved the others
from. And this is what the world calls a gentleman
and a man of honour!"</p>

<p>"For one so good, so full of pity to others, yours are
harsh words."</p>

<p>"Because I feel I have been unworthily treated. M.
d'Harville easily penetrated the girlish openness of my
character; why, then, did he not trust to my sympathy
and generosity of feeling, and tell me the whole truth?"</p>

<p>"Because you would have refused him."</p>

<p>"This very expression proves how guilty he was, and
how treacherous was his conduct, if he really entertained
the idea of my rejecting his hand if informed of
the truth!"</p>

<p>"He loved you too well to incur the risk of losing
you."</p>

<p>"No, no, my lord; had he really loved me, he would
never have sacrificed me to his selfish passion. Nay, so
wretched was my position at that time, and such was
my desire to quit my father's roof, that, had he been
candid and explicit with me, it is more than probable
he would have moved me to pity the species of misery he
was condemned to endure, and to sympathise with one
so cut off from the tender ties which sweeten life. I
really believe, at this moment, that, touched by his open,
manly confession, as well as interested for one labouring
under so severe an infliction of the Almighty's hand, I
should scarcely have had the courage to refuse him my
hand; and, once aware of all I had undertaken, nothing
should have deterred me from the full and conscientious
discharge of every solemn duty towards him. But to
compel this pity and interest, merely because he had me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in his power, and to exact my consideration and sympathy,
because, unhappily, I was his wife, and had sworn to
obligations, the full force of which had been concealed
from me, was at once the act of a coward and a wrong-judging
mind. How could I hold myself bound to endure
the heavy penalties of my unfortunate marriage,
when my husband had trampled on every tie which binds
an honourable mind? And now, my lord, you may form
some little idea of my wedded life; you are now aware
how shamefully I was deceived, and that, too, by the
person in whose hands I unsuspectingly placed the future
happiness of my whole existence. I had implicitly
trusted in M. d'Harville, and he had most dishonourably
and treacherously repaid my trustfulness with bitter and
irremediable wrongs. The gentle, timid melancholy
which had so greatly interested me in his favour, and
which he attributed to pious recollections, was, in truth,
only the workings of a conscience ill at ease, and the
knowledge of his own incurable infirmity."</p>

<p>"Still, were he a stranger or an enemy, a heart so
noble and generous as yours would pity such sufferings
as he endures?"</p>

<p>"But can I calm those sufferings? If he could
distinguish my voice, or if only a look of recognition
answered my sorrowing glance! But no. Oh, my
lord, it is impossible for such as have never seen them
to form an idea of those frightful paroxysms, in which
every sense is suspended, and the unfortunate sufferer
merely recovers from his frenzy to fall into a sort of
sullen dejection! When my dear child experiences one
of these attacks, it almost breaks my heart to see her
tender frame twisted, stiffened, and distorted, by the
dreadful convulsions which accompany it. Still, she is
my own, my beloved infant, and, when I see her bitter
agonies, my hatred and aversion to her father are increased
an hundredfold. But, when my poor child
becomes calmer, so does my irritation against my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
subside also; and then&mdash;ah, then&mdash;the natural
tenderness of my heart makes my angry feelings give
place to a species of sorrow and pity for him. Yet
surely I did not marry at only seventeen years of age
merely to experience the alternations of hatred and painful
commiseration, and to weep over a frail and sickly
infant, whom, after all, I may not be permitted to rear.
And, as regards this beloved object of my incessant
prayers, permit me, my lord, to anticipate a reproach I
doubtless deserve, and which you would be unwilling to
make. My daughter, young as she is, is capable of
interesting my affections and fully occupying my heart;
but the love she inspires is so cruelly mixed with present
anguish and future apprehensions, that my tenderness
for my child invariably ends in tears and bitter grief.
When I am with her, my heart is torn with agony,
a heavy, crushing weight presses on my heart at the
thoughts of her hopeless, suffering state. Not all the
fondest devices of a mother's love can overcome a malady
pronounced by all our faculty as incurable. Thus, then,
by way of relief and refuge from the atmosphere of
wretchedness which surrounded me, I had pictured to
myself the possibility of finding calm and repose for my
troubled spirit in an attachment, so vain, so empty,
that&mdash;But I have been deceived a second time, most
unworthily deceived; and there is now nothing left for
me but to resign myself to the gloom and misery of the
life my husband's want of candour has entailed upon me.
But tell me, my lord, is it such an existence as I was
justified in expecting when I bestowed my hand on M.
d'Harville? And am I alone to blame for those injuries,
to avenge which my husband had this day determined
to take my life? My fault was great, very great; and
the more so, because the object I had selected was every
way so unworthy, and leaves me the additional shame
of having to blush for my choice. Happily for me, my
lord, the conversation you overheard between the Countess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Sarah and her brother on the subject of M.
Charles Robert spares me much of the humiliation
I should otherwise have experienced in making this
confession. I only venture to hope that, since listening
to my relation, you may be induced to consider
me as much an object of pity as I admit I am of
blame."</p>

<p>"I cannot express to you, madame, how deeply your
narrative has touched me. What gnawing grief, what
hidden sorrows have you not been called upon to endure,
from the death of your mother to the birth of your child!
Who would ever believe such ills could reach one so
envied, so admired, and so calculated to enjoy and impart
happiness to others?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, there are some sorrows so deep, so
unapproachable, that for worlds we would not even have
them suspected; and the severest increase of suffering
would arise from the very doubt of our being the enviable
creatures we are believed to be."</p>

<p>"You are right; nothing would be more painful than
the question, openly expressed, 'Is she or he as happy as
they seem to be?' Still, if there is any happiness in the
knowledge, be assured you are not the only one who has
to struggle with the fearful contrast between reality and
that which the world believes."</p>

<p>"How so, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the eyes of all who know you, your husband
is esteemed even happier than yourself, since he
possesses one so rich in every good gift; and yet is not he
also much to be pitied? Can there be a more miserable
existence than the one he leads? He has acted unfairly
and selfishly towards you, but has he not been bitterly
punished? He loves you with a passion, deep and sincere,
worthy of you to have inspired, yet he knows that
your only feeling towards him is insurmountable aversion
and contempt. In his feeble, suffering child he
beholds a constant reproach; nor is that all he is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
upon to endure; jealousy also assails him with her nameless
tortures."</p>

<p>"And how can I help that, my lord? By giving him
no occasion for jealousy, you reply. And certainly you
are right. But, think you, because no other person
would possess my love, it would any the more be his?
He knows full well it would not. Since the fearful scene
I related to you, we have lived entirely apart, while in
the eyes of the world I have kept up every necessary
appearance of married happiness. With the exception
of yourself, my lord, I have never breathed a syllable of
this fatal secret to mortal ears: thus, therefore, I venture
to ask advice of you I could not solicit from any
human being."</p>

<p>"And I, madame, can with truth assure you that, if
the trifling service I have rendered you be deemed worthy
of notice, I hold myself a thousand times overpaid by
the confidence you have reposed in me. But, since
you deign to ask my advice, and permit me to speak
candidly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my lord, I beseech you to use the frankness
and sincerity you would show to a sister!"</p>

<p>"Then allow me to tell you that, for want of employing
one of your most precious qualities, you lose vast
enjoyments, which would not only fill up that void in
your heart, but would distract you from your domestic
sorrows and supply that need of stirring emotions, excitement,
and," added the prince, smiling, "I dare almost to
venture to add,&mdash;pray forgive me for having so bad an
opinion of your sex,&mdash;that natural love for mystery and
intrigue which exercises so powerful an empire over
many, if not all, females."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my lord?"</p>

<p>"I mean that, if you would play at the game of doing
good, nothing would please or interest you more."</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville surveyed Rodolph with astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"And understand," resumed he, "I speak not of sending
large sums carelessly, almost disdainfully, to unfortunate
creatures, of whom you know nothing, and who
are frequently undeserving of your favour. But if you
would amuse yourself, as I do, at playing, from time to
time, at the game of Providence, you would acknowledge
that occasionally our good deeds put on all the piquancy
and charms of a romance."</p>

<p>"I must confess, my lord," said Clémence, with a
smile, "it never occurred to me to class charity under
the head of amusements."</p>

<p>"It is a discovery I owe to my horror of all tediums,
all wearisome, long-protracted affairs,&mdash;a sort of horror
which has been principally inspired by long political conferences
and ministerial discussions. But to return to
our game of amusing beneficence: I cannot, alas, aspire
to possess that disinterested virtue which makes some
people content to entrust others with the office of either
ill or well distributing their bounty, and, if it merely
required me to send one of my chamberlains to carry a
few hundred louis to each of the divisions in and around
Paris, I confess, to my shame, that the scheme would
not interest me nearly as much as it does at present,
while doing good, after my notions on the subject, is
one of the most entertaining and exciting amusements
you can imagine. I prefer the word 'amusing,' because
to me it conveys the idea of all that pleases, charms, and
allures us. And, really, madame, if you would only become
my accomplice in a few dark intrigues of this sort,
you would see that, apart from the praiseworthiness of
the action, nothing is really more curious, inviting, attractive,
or diverting, than these charitable adventures.
And then, what mystery is requisite to conceal the benefits
we render! what precautions to prevent ourselves
from being discovered! what varied, yet powerful, emotions
are excited at the aspect of poor but worthy people
shedding tears of joy and calling down Heaven's blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
on your head! Depend upon it, such a group is, after
all, more gratifying than the pale, angry countenance of
either a jealous or an unfaithful lover, and there are very
few who do not class either under one head or the other.
The emotions I describe are closely allied to those you
experienced this morning while going to the Rue du
Temple. Simply dressed, that you may escape observation,
you go forth with a palpitating heart; you also
ascend with a throbbing breast some modest <i>fiacre</i>, carefully
drawing down the blinds to prevent yourself from
being seen; then, looking cautiously from side to side
that you are not observed, you quickly enter a mean-looking
dwelling, just like this morning, you see, the
only difference being that, whereas to-day you said, 'If
I am discovered I am lost!' then you would only smile
as you mentally uttered, 'If I am discovered, they will
overwhelm me with praises and blessings!' Now,
since you possess your many adorable qualities in all
their pure modesty, you would employ the most artful
schemes, the most complicated man&oelig;uvres, to prevent
yourself from being known, and, consequently, wept over
and blessed as an angel of goodness."</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord," cried Madame d'Harville, deeply
moved, "you are indeed my preserver! I cannot
express the new ideas, the consoling hopes, awakened
within me by your words. You are quite right; to endeavour
to gain the blessing and gratitude of such as are
poor and in misery is almost equal to being loved even
as I would wish to be; nay, it is even superior in its
purity and absence of self. When I compare the existence
I now venture to anticipate with the shameful and
degraded lot I was preparing for myself, my own reproaches
become more bitter and severe."</p>

<p>"I should, indeed, be grieved," said Rodolph, smiling,
"were that to be the case, since all my desire is to make
you forget the past, and to prove to you that there are
various modes of recreating and distracting our minds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the means of good and evil are very frequently nearly
the same: it is the end, only, which differs. In a word,
if good is as attractive, as amusing, as evil, why should
we prefer the latter? I am going to use a very commonplace
and hackneyed simile. Why do many women
take as lovers men not nearly as worthy of that distinction
as their own husbands? Because the greatest charm
of love consists in the difficulties which surround it; for
once deprived of the hopes, the fears, the anxieties, difficulties,
mysteries, and dangers, and little or nothing
would remain, merely the lover, stripped of all the prestige
derivable from these causes, and a very every-day
object he would appear; very much after the fashion
of the individual who, when asked by a friend why he
did not marry his mistress, replied, 'Why, I was thinking
of it; but, if I did, where should I go to pass my
evenings?'"</p>

<p>"Your picture is coloured after nature, my lord," said
Madame d'Harville, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I can find the means of enabling you
to experience the fears, the anxieties, the excitement,
which seem to have such charms for you, if I can render
useful your natural love for mystery and romance, your
inclination for dissimulation and artifice,&mdash;you see my
bad opinion of your sex will peep out in spite of me,"
added Rodolph, gaily,&mdash;"shall I not change into fine
and generous qualities instincts which otherwise are
mere ungovernable and unmanageable impulses, excellent,
if well employed, most fatal, if directed badly?
Now, then, what do you say? Shall we get up all
manner of benevolent plots and charitable dissipations?
We will have our rendezvous, our correspondence, our
secrets, and, above all, we will carefully conceal all our
doings from the marquis, for your visit of to-day to the
Morels has, in all probability, excited his suspicions.
There, you see, it only requires your consent to commence
a regular intrigue."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"I accept with joy and gratitude the mysterious associations
you propose, my lord," said Clémence; "and, by
way of beginning our romance, I will return to-morrow
to visit those poor creatures to whom, unfortunately, this
morning I could only utter a few words of consolation;
for, taking advantage of my terror and alarm, the purse
you so thoughtfully supplied me with was stolen from
me by a lame boy as I ascended the stairs. Ah, my
lord," added Clémence (and her countenance lost the
expression of gentle gaiety by which a few minutes
before it was animated), "if you only knew what misery,
what a picture of wretchedness&mdash;no! oh, no! I
never could have believed so horrid a scene, or that such
want existed; and yet I bewail my condition and complain
of my severe destiny."</p>

<p>Rodolph, wishing to conceal from Madame d'Harville
how deeply he was touched at this application of the
woes of others, as teaching patience and resignation, yet
fully recognising in the meek and subdued spirit the fine
and noble qualities of her mind, said, gaily:</p>

<p>"With your permission, I shall except the Morels
from your jurisdiction; you shall resign them to my
care, and, above all things, promise me not again to
enter that miserable place, for, to tell you the truth,
I live there."</p>

<p>"You, my lord? What an idea!"</p>

<p>"Nay, but you really must believe me when I say
I live there, for it is actually true. I confess mine is
somewhat a humble lodging, a mere matter of eight
pounds a year, in addition to which I pay the large
and liberal sum of six francs a month to the porteress,
Madame Pipelet, that ugly old woman you saw; but, to
make up for all this, I have as my next neighbour, Mlle.
Rigolette, the prettiest grisette in the Quartier du Temple.
And you must allow that, for a merchant's clerk,
with a salary of only seventy-two pounds a year (I pass
as a clerk), such a domicile is well suited to my means."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your unhoped-for presence in that fatal house proves
to me that you are speaking seriously, my lord; some
generous action leads you there, no doubt! But what
good action do you reserve for me? What part do you
propose for me to sustain?"</p>

<p>"That of an angel of consolation, and&mdash;pray excuse
and allow me the word&mdash;a very demon of cunning and
man&oelig;uvres! For there are some wounds so painful, as
well as delicate, that the hand of a woman only can
watch over and heal them. There are, also, unfortunate
beings so proud, so reserved, and so hidden from
observation, that it requires uncommon penetration to
discover them, and an irresistible charm to win their
confidence."</p>

<p>"And when shall I have an opportunity of displaying
the penetration and skill for which you give me credit?"
asked Madame d'Harville, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Soon, I hope, you will have to make a conquest
worthy of you; but, to succeed, you must employ all
your most ingenious resources."</p>

<p>"And when, my lord, will you confide this great secret
to me?"</p>

<p>"Let me see! You perceive, we have already got
as far as arranging our rendezvous. Could you do
me the favour to grant me an audience in four days'
time?"</p>

<p>"Dear me! so long first?" said Clémence, innocently.</p>

<p>"But what would become of the mystery of the affair,
and all the strict forms and appearances necessary to be
kept up, if we were to meet sooner? Just imagine! If
our partnership were suspected, people would be on their
guard, and we should seldom achieve our purpose. I may
very probably have to write to you. Who was that aged
female who brought me your note?"</p>

<p>"An old servant of my mother's, the very personification
of prudence and discretion."</p>

<p>"I will then address my letters under cover to her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and she will deliver them into your hands. If you are
kind enough to return any answer, address 'To M.
Rodolph, Rue Plumet,' and let your maid put your
letters in the post."</p>

<p>"I will do that myself, my lord, when taking my
usual morning's walk."</p>

<p>"Do you often walk out alone?"</p>

<p>"In fine weather nearly every day."</p>

<p>"That's right! It is a custom all young women
should observe from the very earliest period of their
marriage,&mdash;either from a good or an improper provision
against future evil. The habit once established,
it becomes what the lawyers style a precedent; and, in
subsequent days, these habitual promenades excite no
dangerous interpretations. If I had been a woman,&mdash;and,
between ourselves, I fear I should have been very charitable,
but equally flighty,&mdash;the very day after my marriage
I should, in all possible innocence, have taken
the most mysterious steps, and, with perfect simplicity,
have involved myself in all manner of suspicious and
compromising proceedings, for the purpose of establishing
the precedent I spoke of, in order to be at liberty
either to visit my poor pensioners or to meet my
lover."</p>

<p>"But that would be downright perfidy to one's husband,
would it not, my lord?" said Madame d'Harville,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for you, madame, you have never been
driven to the necessity of admitting the utility of such
provisionary measures."</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville's smile left her lips. She cast
down her eyes, and, blushing deeply, said, in a low and
sad voice, "This is not generous, my lord!"</p>

<p>At first Rodolph regarded the marquise with astonishment,
then added, "I understand you, madame. But,
once for all, let us weigh well your position as regards
M. Charles Robert. I will just imagine that one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
your acquaintances may one day have pointed out to
you one of those pitiable-looking mendicants who roll
their eyes most sentimentally, and play on the clarionet
with desperate energy, to awaken the sympathy of the
passers-by. 'That is really and truly a genuine case of
distress,' observes your friend. 'That interesting musician
has at least seven children, and a wife deaf, dumb,
blind,' etc. 'Ah, poor fellow!' you reply, charitably
aiding him with your purse. And so, each time you
meet this case of genuine distress, the clarionet-player,
the moment he discerns you from afar, fixes his imploring
eyes upon you, while the most touching strains of his
instrument are directed to touch your charitable sympathies,
and that, too, so successfully, that again your purse
opens at this fresh appeal. One day, more than usually
disposed to pity this very unfortunate object by the importunities
of the friend who first pointed him out to
you, and who is most wickedly abusing your generous
heart, you resolve to visit this case of genuine distress,
as your false friend terms it, and to behold the poor
object of your solicitude in the midst of his misery.
Well, you go. But, lo! the grief-stricken musician has
vanished; and in his place you find a lively, rollicking
fellow, enjoying himself over some of the good things of
this world, and mirthfully carolling forth the last new
alehouse catch. Then disgust succeeds to pity; for you
have bestowed your sympathy and charity alike upon an
impostor, neither more nor less. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>Madame d'Harville could not restrain a smile at this
singular apologue. She, however, soon checked it, as
she added:</p>

<p>"However grateful I may feel for this mode of justifying
my great imprudence, my lord, I can but confess I
dare not avail myself of so favourable a pretext as that
of mistaken charity."</p>

<p>"Yet, after all, yours was an error based upon motives
of noble and generous pity for the wounded feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
one you believed a genuine object for commiseration.
Fortunately, there are so many ways left you of atoning
for one indiscretion, that your regret need be but small.
Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing M. d'Harville
this evening?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord. The scene of this morning has so
much affected him that he is&mdash;ill," said the marquise,
in a low, tremulous tone.</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Rodolph, sadly, "I understand! Come,
courage! you were saying that you required an aim, a
motive, a means of directing your thoughts. Permit me
to hope that all this will be accomplished by following
out the plan I have proposed. Your heart will be then
so filled with the delightful recollection of all the happiness
you have caused, and all the good you have effected,
that, in all probability, you will find no room for resentment
against your husband. In place of angry feelings,
you will regard him with the same sorrowing pity you
look on your dear child. And as for the interesting
little creature herself, now you have confided to me the
cause of her delicate health, I almost think myself warranted
in bidding you yet to entertain hopes of overcoming
the fearful complaint which has hitherto affected
her tender frame."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord!" exclaimed Clémence, clasping her
hands with eagerness, "can it be possible? How? In
what manner can my child be saved?"</p>

<p>"I have, as physician to myself and household, a man
almost unknown, though possessed of a first-rate science.
Great part of his life was passed in America; and I remember
his speaking to me of some marvellous cures
performed by him on slaves attacked by this distressing
complaint."</p>

<p>"And do you really think, my lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, you must not allow yourself to dwell too confidently
upon success; the disappointment would be so
very severe. Only, do not let us wholly despair."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>Clémence d'Harville cast a hasty glance of unutterable
gratitude over the noble features of Rodolph, the
firm, unflinching friend, who reconciled her to herself
with so much good sense, intelligence, and delicacy of
feeling. Then she asked herself how, for one instant, she
could ever have been interested in the fate of such a being
as M. Charles Robert,&mdash;the very idea was hateful to her.</p>

<p>"What do I not owe you, my lord?" cried she, in a
voice of thrilling emotion; "you console me for the past;
you open to me a glimpse of hope for my child; and you
place before me a plan of future occupation which shall
afford me both consolation and the delight of doing my
duty. Ah, was I not right when I said that, if you would
come here to-night, you would finish the day as you had
begun it,&mdash;by performing a good action?"</p>

<p>"And pray, madame, do not omit to add,&mdash;an action
after my own heart, where all is pleasure and unmixed
enjoyment in its performance. And now, adieu!" said
Rodolph, rising as the clock struck half-past eleven.</p>

<p>"Adieu, my lord, and pray do not forget to send me
news ere long of those poor people in the Rue du Temple."</p>

<p>"I will see them to-morrow, for, unfortunately, I knew
not of that little limping rascal having stolen your purse;
and I fear that the unhappy creatures are in the most
deplorable want. Have the kindness to bear in mind
that, in the course of four days, I shall come to explain
to you the nature of the part you will be required to
undertake. One thing I must prepare you for; and that
is, the probability of its being requisite for you to assume
a disguise on the occasion."</p>

<p>"A disguise? Oh, how charming! What sort of
one, my lord?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you at present. I will leave the choice
to you."</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>"All that is requisite," said the prince, on his return
home, "to save this excellent woman from the perils of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
another attachment, is to fill her mind with generous
thoughts; and, since an invincible repugnance separates
her from her husband, to employ her love for the
romantic in such charitable actions as shall require
being enshrouded in mystery."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h5>MISERY.</h5>


<p>The reader has probably not forgotten that the garret
in the Rue du Temple was occupied by an unfortunate
family, the father of whom was a working lapidary,
named Morel. We shall now endeavour to describe the
wretched abode of Morel and his children.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock in the morning; a deep silence
dwelt around. The streets were still deserted, for the
snow fell fast, and the cold, biting wind froze as it blew.
A miserable candle, stuck upon a small block of wood,
and supported by two slips of the same material,
scarcely penetrated with its yellow, flickering light the
misty darkness of the garret,&mdash;a narrow, low-built
place, two-thirds of which was formed by the sloping
roof, which communicated by a sharp angle with the
wretched flooring, and freely exposed the moss-covered
tiles of the outer roof. Walls covered with plaster,
blackened by time, and split into countless crevices, displayed
the rotten, worm-eaten laths, which formed the
frail division from other chambers, while in one corner
of this deplorable habitation a door off the hinges opened
upon a narrow staircase. The ground, of a nameless
colour, but foul, fetid, and slippery, was partly strewed
with bits of dirty straw, old rags, and bones, the residue
of that unwholesome and vitiated food sold by the
dealers in condemned meat, and frequently bought by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
starving wretches, for the purpose of gnawing the few
cartilages that may adhere.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is no uncommon thing to meet, in densely crowded parts of Paris,
with persons who openly sell the flesh of animals born dead, as well as of
others who have died of disease, etc.</p></div>
</div>

<p>So wretched a condition either arises from improvidence
and vice, or from unavoidable misery,&mdash;misery so
great, so overwhelming and paralysing, as to enfeeble
every energy, and to render the unhappy object of it too
hopeless, too despairing, even to attempt to extricate
himself from the squalor of his utter destitution, and he
crouches in his dirt and desolation like an animal in its
den.</p>

<p>During the day, Morel's garret was lighted by a
species of long, narrow skylight formed in the descending
roof, framed and glazed, and made to open and shut
by means of a pulley and string; but, at the hour which
we are describing, a heavy fall of snow encumbered the
window, and effectually prevented its affording any light.
The candle placed on Morel's working-table, which stood
in the centre of the chamber, diffused a kind of halo of
pale, sickly beams, which, gradually diminishing, was at
last lost in the dim shadow which overspread the place,
in whose murky duskiness might be seen the faint outline
of several white-looking masses. On the work-table,
which was merely a heavy and roughly cut wooden
block of unpolished oak, covered with grease and soot,
lay, loosely scattered about, a handful of rubies and
diamonds, of more than ordinary size and brilliancy,
while, as the mean rays of the small candle were
reflected on them, they glittered and sparkled like so
many coruscating fires.</p>

<p>Morel was a worker of real stones, and not false ones,
as he had given out, and as was universally believed, in
the Rue du Temple. Thanks to this innocent deception,
the costly jewels entrusted to him were merely supposed
to be so many pieces of glass, too valueless to tempt the
cupidity of any one. Such riches, confided to the care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of one as poor and miserably destitute as Morel, will
render any reference to the honesty of his character
quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Seated on a high stool, and wholly overcome by
fatigue, cold, and weariness, after a long winter's night,
passed in unceasing labour, the poor lapidary had fallen
asleep on his block, with his head upon his half-frozen
arms, and his forehead resting against a small grindstone,
placed horizontally on the table, and generally put
in motion by a little hand-wheel, while a fine steel saw,
and various other tools belonging to his trade, were
lying beside him. The man himself, of whom nothing
but the skull, surrounded by a fringe of gray hairs, was
visible, was dressed in a shabby fustian jacket, without
any species of linen or garment beneath it, and an old
pair of cloth trousers, while his worn-out slippers scarcely
concealed the blue, cold feet they partially covered, from
resting solely on the damp, shiny floor; and so bitter,
so freezing, was the sharp winter wind which freely
entered into this scarcely human dwelling, that, spite of
the weariness and exhaustion of the overworked artisan,
his frame shuddered and shivered with involuntary frequency.
The length of the wick of the unsnuffed candle
bespoke the length of time even this uneasy slumber
must have lasted, and no sound save his troubled and
irregular breathing broke the deathlike silence that
prevailed; for, alas! the other occupants of this mean
abode were not so fortunate as to be able to forget their
sufferings in sleep. Yet this narrow, pent-up, unwholesome
spot contained no less than seven other persons,&mdash;five
children, the youngest of whom was four years
of age, the eldest twelve, a sick and declining wife, with
an aged grandmother, the parent of Morel's wife, now in
her eightieth year, and an idiot!</p>

<p>The cold must have been intense, indeed, when the
natural warmth of so many persons, so closely packed
together in so small a place, could not in any way affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the freezing atmosphere; it was evident, therefore, to
speak scientifically, that but little caloric was given out
by the poor, weak, emaciated, shivering creatures, all
suffering and almost expiring with cold and hunger,
from the puny infant to the idiotic old grandmother.</p>

<p>With the exception of the father of the family, who
had temporarily yielded to the aching of his heavy eyelids,
no other creature slept,&mdash;no other; because cold,
starvation, and sickness will not allow so sweet an
enjoyment as the closing the eyes in peaceful rest.
Little does the world believe how rarely comes that
sound, healthful, and refreshing slumber to the poor
man's pillow, which at once invigorates the mind and
body, and sends the willing labourer back to his toil
refreshed and recruited by the blessing of a beneficent
Creator. To taste of nature's sweet, refreshing, balmy
sleep, sickness, sorrow, poverty, and mental disquietude
must not share the humble pallet.</p>

<p>In contrasting the deep misery of the poor artisan, with
whose woes we are now occupying the reader, with the
immense value of the jewelry confided to him, we are
struck by one of those comparisons which afflict while
they elevate the mind. With the distracting spectacle
of his family's want and wretchedness, embracing a wide
field from cold and hunger to drivelling idiocy, constantly
before his eyes, this man, in the pursuance of his
daily labour, is compelled to touch and handle and gaze
upon bright and sparkling gems, the smallest of which
would be a mine of wealth to him, and save those dearest
to him from sufferings and privations which wring
his very heart; would snatch them from the slow and
lingering death which is consuming them before his
eyes. Yet, amid all these trials and temptations, the
artisan remains firmly, truly, and unflinchingly honest,
and would no more appropriate one of the glittering
stones entrusted to him than he would satisfy his hunger
at the expense of his starving babes. Doubtless the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
but performed his duty to his employer,&mdash;his simple
duty; but because it is enjoined to all to be honest and
faithful in that which is committed to them, does that
render the action itself less noble, magnanimous, or
praiseworthy? Is not this unfortunate artisan, so courageously,
so bravely upright and honest while entrusted
with the property of another, the type and model of an
immense class of working people, who, doomed to a life
of continual poverty and privation, see, with calm, patient
looks, thousands of their brethren rolling in splendour
and abounding in riches, yet they toil on, resigned and
unenvying, but still industriously striving for bread their
hardest efforts cannot always procure? And is there
not something consolatory, as well as gratifying to our
feelings, to consider that it is neither force nor terror,
but good natural sense and a right mind which alone restrain
this formidable ocean, this heaving mass, whose
bounds once broken, a moral inundation would ensue, in
which society itself would be swallowed up? Shall we,
then, refuse to cooperate with all the powers of our mind
and body with those generous and enlightened spirits,
who ask but a little sunshine for so much misfortune,
courage, and resignation?</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Let us now return to the, alas! too true specimen of
distressing want we shall endeavour to describe in all its
fearful and startling reality.</p>

<p>The lapidary possessed only a thin mattress and a portion
of a blanket appropriated to the old grandmother,
who, in her stupid and ferocious selfishness, would not
allow any person to share them with her. In the beginning
of the winter she had become quite violent, and
had even attempted to strangle the youngest child, who
had been put to sleep with her. This poor infant was a
sickly little creature, of about four years old, now far
gone in consumption, and who found it too cold inside
the mattress, where she slept with her brothers and sisters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Hereafter we shall explain this mode of sleeping
so frequently employed by the very poor, in comparison
with whom the very animals are treated luxuriously, for
their litter is changed. Such was the picture presented
in the humble garret of the poor lapidary, when the eye
was enabled to pierce the gloomy penumbra caused by the
flickering rays of the candle. By the side of the partition
wall, not less damp and cracked than the others,
was placed on the floor the mattress on which the idiot
grandmother reposed; as she could not bear anything on
her head, her white hair was cut very short, and revealed
the shape of her head and flat forehead; while her shaggy,
gray eyebrows shaded the deep orbits, from which glared
a wild, savage, yet crafty look; her pale, hollow, wrinkled
cheeks hung upon the bones of the face and the sharp
angles of her jaws. Lying upon her side, and almost
doubled up, her chin nearly touching her knees, she lay,
shivering with cold, beneath the gray rug, too small to
cover her all over, and which, as she drew it over her
shoulders, exposed her thin, emaciated legs, as well as
the wretched old petticoat in which she was clad. An
odour most fetid and repulsive issued from this bed.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the mattress of the grandmother,
and still extending along the side of the wall,
was placed the <i>paillasse</i> which served as a sleeping-place
for the five children, who were accommodated after the
following manner:</p>

<p>An opening was made at each side of the cloth which
covered the straw, and the children were inserted into
this bed, or, rather, foul and noisome dunghill, the outer
case serving both for sheet and counterpane. Two little
girls, one of whom was extremely ill, shivered on one
side, and three young boys on the other, all going to bed
without undressing, if, indeed, the miserable rags they
wore could be termed clothes. Masses of thick, dry,
light hair, tangled, ragged, and uncombed, left uncut because
their poor mother fancied it helped to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
warm, half covered their pale, thin, pinched features.
One of the boys drew, with his cold, benumbed fingers,
the covering over their straw bed up to his chin, in order
to defend himself from the cold; while another, fearful
of exposing his hands to the influence of the frost, tried
to grasp the bed-covering with his teeth, which rattled
and shook in his head; while a third strove to huddle
up to his brothers in the hopes of gaining a little warmth.
The youngest of the two girls, fatally attacked by consumption,
leaned her poor little face, which already bore
the hue of death, languidly against the chilly bosom of
her sister, a girl just one year older, who vainly sought,
by pressing her in her arms, to impart comfort and ease
to the little sufferer, over whom she watched with the
anxious solicitude of a parent.</p>

<p>On another <i>paillasse</i>, also placed on the ground, at the
foot of that of the children, the wife of the artisan
was extended, groaning in helpless exhaustion from
the effects of a slow fever and an internal complaint,
which had not permitted her to quit her bed for several
months. Madeleine Morel was in her thirty-sixth year;
a blue cotton handkerchief, tied round her low forehead,
made the bilious pallor of her countenance and sharp,
emaciated features still more conspicuous. A dark halo
encircled her hollow, sunken eyes, while her lips were
split and bleeding from the effects of the fever which
consumed her; her dejected, grief-worn physiognomy,
and small, insignificant features, indicated one of those
gentle but weak natures, without resource or energy,
which unable to struggle with misfortunes, yield at once,
and know no remedy but vain and ceaseless lamentations
and regrets. Weak, spiritless, and of limited capacity,
she had remained honest because her husband was so;
had she been left to herself, it is probable that ignorance
and misfortune might have depraved her mind and driven
her to any lengths. She loved her husband and her children,
but she had neither the courage nor resolution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
restrain giving vent to loud and open complaints respecting
their mutual misery; and frequently was the lapidary,
whose unflinching labour alone maintained the family,
obliged to quit his work to console and pacify the poor
valetudinarian. Over and above an old ragged sheet of
coarse brown cloth, which partially covered his wife,
Morel had, in order to impart a little warmth, laid a few
old clothes, so worn out, and patched and pieced, that the
pawnbroker had refused to have anything to do with them.</p>

<p>A stove, a saucepan, a damaged earthen stewpan, two
or three cracked cups, scattered about on the floor, a
bucket, a board to wash on, and a large stone pitcher,
placed beneath the angle of the roof near the broken
door, which the wind kept continually blowing to and
fro, completed the whole of the family possessions.</p>

<p>This picture of squalid misery and desolation was
lighted up by the candle, whose flame, agitated by the
cold northeasterly wind which found its way through
the tiles on the roof, sometimes imparted a pale, unearthly
light on the wretched scene, and then, playing on
the heaps of diamonds and rubies lying beside the sleeping
artisan, caused a thousand scintillating sparks to
spring forth and dazzle the eye with their prismatic rays
of brightness.</p>

<p>Although the profoundest silence reigned around,
seven out of the eight unfortunate dwellers in this attic
were awake; and each, from the grandmother to the
youngest child, watched the sleeping lapidary with intense
emotion, as their only hope, their only resource,
and, in their childlike selfishness, they murmured at seeing
him thus inactive and relinquishing that labour which
they well knew was all they had to depend on; but with
different feelings of regret and uneasiness did the lookers-on
observe the slumber of the toil-worn man. The
mother trembled for her children's meal; the children
thought but of themselves; while the idiot neither thought
of nor cared for any one. All at once she sat upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in her wretched bed, crossed her long, bony arms, yellow
and dry as box-wood, on her shrivelled bosom, and kept
watching the candle with twinkling eyes; then, rising
slowly and stealthily, she crept along, trailing after her
her old ragged coverlet, which clung around her as
though it had been her winding-sheet. She was above
the middle height, and her hair being so closely shaven
made her head appear disproportionately small; a sort
of spasmodic movement kept up a constant trembling in
her thick, pendulous under-lip, while her whole countenance
offered the hideous model of ferocious stupidity.
Slowly and cautiously the idiot approached the lapidary's
work-table, like a child about to commit some forbidden
act. When she reached the candle, she held her two
trembling hands over the flame; and such was their
skeleton-like condition, that the flickering light shone
through them, imparting a pale, livid hue to her features.
From her pallet Madeleine Morel watched every movement
of the old woman, who, still warming herself over
the candle, stooped her head, and with a silly kind of
delight watched the sparkling of the diamonds and
rubies, which lay glittering on the table. Wholly absorbed
in the wondrous contemplation of such bright and
beautiful things, the idiot allowed her hands to fall into
the flame of the candle, nor did she seem to recollect
where they were till the sense of burning recalled her
attention, when she manifested her pain and anger by a
harsh, screaming cry.</p>

<p>At this sound Morel started, and quickly raised his
head. He was about forty years of age, with an open,
intelligent, and mild expression of countenance, but yet
wearing the sad, dejected look of one who had been the
sport of misery and misfortune till they had planted
furrows in his cheeks and crushed and broken his spirit.
A gray beard of many weeks' growth covered the lower
part of his face, which was deeply marked by the smallpox;
premature wrinkles furrowed his already bald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
forehead; while his red and inflamed eyelids showed the
overtaxed and sleepless days and nights of toil he so
courageously endured. A circumstance, but too common
with such of the working class as are doomed by their
occupation to remain nearly all day in one position, had
warped his figure, and, acting upon a naturally feeble
constitution, had produced a contraction of his whole
frame. Continually obliged to stoop over his work-table
and to lean to the left, in order to keep his grindstone
going, the lapidary, in a manner petrified, ossified in the
attitude he was frequently obliged to preserve from
twelve to fifteen hours a day, had acquired an habitual
stoop of the shoulders, and was completely drawn on one
side. So his left arm, incessantly exercised by the difficult
management of the grindstone, had acquired a considerable
muscular development; whilst the right arm,
always inert and leaning on the table, the better to present
the faces of the diamonds to the action of the grindstone,
had wasted to the most extreme attenuation; his
wasted limbs, almost paralysed by complete want of exercise,
could scarcely support the weary, worn-out body, as
though all strength, substance, and vitality had concentrated
themselves in the only part called into play when
toiling for the subsistence of, with himself, eight human
creatures.</p>

<p>And often would poor Morel touchingly observe: "It
is not for myself that I care to eat, but to give strength
to the arm which turns the mill."</p>

<p>Awaking with a sudden start, the lapidary found himself
directly opposite to the poor idiot.</p>

<p>"What ails you? what is the matter, mother?" said
Morel; and then added, in a lower tone, for fear of
awaking the family, whom he hoped and believed were
asleep, "Go back to bed, mother; Madeleine and the
children are asleep!"</p>

<p>"No, father," cried the eldest of the little girls, "I
am awake; I am trying to warm poor little Adèle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I am too hungry to go to sleep," added one of
the boys; "it was not my turn to-night to have supper
with Mlle. Rigolette."</p>

<p>"Poor things!" said Morel, sorrowfully; "I thought
you were asleep&mdash;at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was afraid of awaking you, Morel," said the wife,
"or I should have begged of you to give me a drink of
water; I am devoured with thirst! My feverish fit has
come on again!"</p>

<p>"I will directly," said the lapidary; "only let me first
get mother back to bed. Come! come! what are you
meddling with those stones for? Let them alone, I say!"
cried he to the old woman, whose whole attention seemed
riveted upon a splendid ruby, the bright scintillations of
which had so charmed the poor idiot that she was trying
by every possible means to gain possession of it.</p>

<p>"There's a pretty thing! there, there!" replied the
woman, pointing with vehement gestures to the prize she
so ardently coveted.</p>

<p>"I shall be angry in a few minutes," exclaimed Morel,
speaking in a loud voice to terrify his mother-in-law into
submission, and gently pushing back the hand she
advanced to seize her desired treasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, Morel! Morel!" murmured Madeleine, "I am
parching, dying with thirst. How can you be so cruel
as to refuse me a little water?"</p>

<p>"But how can I at present? I must not allow mother
to meddle with these stones,&mdash;perhaps to lose me a
diamond, as she did a year ago; and God alone knows
the wretchedness and misery it cost us,&mdash;ay, may still
occasion us. Ah, that unfortunate loss of the diamond,
what have we not suffered by it!"</p>

<p>As the poor lapidary uttered these words, he passed
his hand over his aching brow with a desponding air,
and said to one of the children:</p>

<p>"Felix, give your mother something to drink. You
are awake, and can attend to her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Madeleine; "he will take cold.
I will wait."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," said the boy, rising, "never mind me.
I shall be quite as warm up as I am in this <i>paillasse</i>."</p>

<p>"Come, will you let the things alone?" cried Morel,
in a threatening tone, to the idiot woman, who kept
bending over the precious stones and trying to seize
them, spite of all his efforts to move her from the
table.</p>

<p>"Mother," called out Felix, "what shall I do? The
water in the pitcher is frozen quite hard."</p>

<p>"Then break the ice," murmured Madeleine.</p>

<p>"It is so thick, I can't," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"Morel!" exclaimed Madeleine, in a querulous and
impatient tone, "since there is nothing but water for me
to drink, let me at least have a draught of that! You
are letting me die with thirst!"</p>

<p>"God of heaven grant me patience!" cried the unfortunate
man. "How can I leave your mother to lose
and destroy these stones? Pray let me manage her
first."</p>

<p>But the lapidary found it no easy matter to get rid
of the idiot, who, beginning to feel irritated at the constant
opposition she met with, gave utterance to her
displeasure in a sort of hideous growl.</p>

<p>"Call her, wife!" said Morel. "She will attend to
you sometimes."</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" called Madeleine, "go to bed,
and be good, and then you shall have some of that nice
coffee you are so fond of!"</p>

<p>"I want that! and that! There! there!" replied the
idiot, making a desperate effort this time to possess herself
of a heap of rubies she particularly coveted. Morel
firmly, but gently, repulsed her,&mdash;all in vain; with
pertinacious obstinacy the old woman kept struggling to
break from his grasp, and snatch the bright gems, on
which she kept her eyes fixed with eager fondness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will never manage her," said Madeleine, "unless
you frighten her with the whip; there is no other means
of making her quiet."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," returned Morel; "but, though she
has no sense, it yet goes to my heart to be obliged to
threaten an old woman, like her, with the whip."</p>

<p>Then, addressing the old woman, who was trying to
bite him, and whom he was holding back with one
hand, he said, in a loud and terrible voice: "Take care;
you'll have the whip on your shoulders if you don't
make haste to bed this very instant!"</p>

<p>These menaces were equally vain with his former
efforts to subdue her. Morel then took a whip which
lay beside his work-table, and, cracking it violently, said:
"Get to bed with you directly! Get to bed!"</p>

<p>As the loud noise of the whip saluted the ear of the
idiot, she hurried away from the lapidary's work-table,
then, suddenly turning around, she uttered low, grumbling
sounds between her clenched teeth; while she surveyed
her son-in-law with looks of the deepest hatred.</p>

<p>"To bed! to bed, I say!" continued he, still advancing,
and feigning to raise his whip with the intention
of striking; while the idiot, holding her fist towards
her son-in-law, retreated backwards to her wretched
couch.</p>

<p>The lapidary, anxious to terminate this painful scene,
that he might be at liberty to attend to his sick wife, kept
still advancing towards the idiot woman, brandishing and
cracking his whip, though without allowing it to touch
the unhappy creature, repeatedly exclaiming, "To bed!
to bed,&mdash;directly! Do you hear?"</p>

<p>The old woman, now thoroughly conquered, and fully
believing in the reality of the threats held out, began to
howl most hideously; and crawling into her bed, like a
dog to his kennel, she kept up a continued series of
cries, screams, and yells, while the frightened children,
believing their poor old grandmother had actually been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
beaten, began crying piteously, exclaiming, "Don't beat
poor granny, father! Pray don't flog granny!"</p>

<p>It is wholly impossible to describe the fearful effect
of these nocturnal horrors, in which were mingled, in
one turmoil of sounds, the supplicating cries of the children,
the furious yellings of the idiot, and the wailing
complaints of the lapidary's sick wife.</p>

<p>To poor Morel such scenes as this were but too
frequent. Still, upon the present occasion, his patience
and courage seemed utterly to forsake him; and, throwing
down the whip upon his work-table, he exclaimed,
in bitter despair, "Oh, what a life! what a life!"</p>

<p>"Is it my fault if my mother is an idiot?" asked
Madeleine, weeping.</p>

<p>"Is it mine, then?" replied Morel. "All I ask for is
peace and quiet enough to allow me to work myself to
death for you all. God knows I labour alike night and
day! Yet I complain not. And, as long as my strength
holds out, I will exert myself to the utmost; but it is
quite impossible for me to attend to my business, and be
at once a keeper to a mad woman and a nurse to sick
people and young children. And Heaven is unjust to
put it upon me,&mdash;yes, I say unjust! It is too much
misery to heap on one man," added Morel, in a tone
bordering on distraction. So saying, the heart-broken
lapidary threw himself on his stool, and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>"Can I help the people at the hospital having refused
to receive my mother, because she was not raving mad?"
asked Madeleine, in a low, peevish, and complaining
voice. "What can I do to alter it? What is the use
of your grumbling to me about my mother? and, if you
fret ever so much about what neither you nor I can
alter, what good will that do?"</p>

<p>"None at all," rejoined the artisan, hastily brushing
the large bitter drops despair had driven to his eyes;
"none whatever,&mdash;you are right; but when everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
goes against you, it is difficult to know what to do
or say."</p>

<p>"Gracious Father!" cried Madeleine; "what an agony
of thirst I am enduring! My lips are parched with the
fever which is consuming me, and yet I shiver as though
death were on me!"</p>

<p>"Wait one instant, and I will give you some drink!"
So saying, Morel took the pitcher which stood beneath
the roof, and, after having with difficulty broken the ice
which covered the water, he filled a cup with the frozen
liquid, and brought it to the bedside of his wife, who
stretched forth her impatient hands to receive it; but,
after a moment's reflection, he said, "No, no, I must
not let you have it cold as this; in your present state of
fever it would be dangerous."</p>

<p>"So much the better if it be dangerous! Quick,
quick&mdash;give it me!" cried Madeleine, with bitterness;
"it will the sooner end my misery, and free you from
such an incumbrance as I am; then you will only have
to look after mad folks and young children,&mdash;there will
be no sick-nurse to take up your time."</p>

<p>"Why do you say such hard words to me, Madeleine?"
asked Morel, mournfully; "you know I do not
deserve them. Pray do not add to my vexations, for I
have scarcely strength or reason enough left to go on
with my work; my head feels as though something were
amiss with it, and I fear much my brain will give way,&mdash;and
then what would become of you all? 'Tis for you I
speak; were there only myself, I should trouble very
little about to-morrow,&mdash;thank Heaven, the river flows
for every one!"</p>

<p>"Poor Morel!" said Madeleine, deeply affected. "I
was very wrong to speak so angrily to you, and to say
I knew you would be glad to get rid of me. Pray forgive
me, for indeed I did not mean any harm; for, after
all, what use am I either to you or the children? For
the last sixteen months I have kept my bed! Gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
God! what I do suffer with thirst! For pity's sake,
husband, give me something to moisten my burning lips!"</p>

<p>"You shall have it directly; I was trying to warm
the cup between my hands."</p>

<p>"How good you are! and yet I could say such wicked
things to you!"</p>

<p>"My poor wife, you are ill and in pain, and that
makes you impatient; say anything you like to me, but
pray never tell me again I wish to get rid of you!"</p>

<p>"But what good am I to any one? what good are our
children? None whatever; on the contrary, they heap
more toil upon you than you can bear."</p>

<p>"True; yet you see that my love for them and you
has endued me with strength and resolution to work
frequently twenty hours out of the twenty-four, till my
body is bent and deformed by such incessant labour.
Do you believe for one instant that I would thus toil
and struggle on my own account? Oh, no! life has no
such charms for me; and if I were the only sufferer, I
would quickly put an end to it."</p>

<p>"And so would I," said Madeleine. "God knows,
but for the children I should have said to you, long ago,
'Morel, we have had more than enough to weary us of
our lives; there is nothing left but to finish our misery
by the help of a pan of charcoal!' But then I recollected
the poor, dear, helpless children, and my heart
would not let me leave them, alone and unprotected, to
starve by themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you see, wife, that the children are,
after all, of real good to us, since they prevent us giving
way to despair, and serve as a motive for exerting
ourselves," replied Morel, with ready ingenuity, yet perfect
simplicity of tone and manner. "Now, then, take your
drink, but only swallow a little at a time, for it is very
cold still."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Morel!" cried Madeleine, snatching
the cup, and drinking it eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enough! enough! no more! you shall not have any
more just now, Madeleine."</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Madeleine, giving back
the cup, "how cold it seems now I have swallowed it,&mdash;it
has brought back those dreadful shiverings!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" ejaculated Morel, "I told you so,&mdash;ah, now
you are quite ill again!"</p>

<p>"I have not strength even to tremble,&mdash;I seem as
though I were covered over with ice."</p>

<p>Morel took off his jacket, and laid it over his wife's
feet, remaining quite naked down to his waist,&mdash;the
unhappy man did not possess a shirt.</p>

<p>"But you will be frozen to death, Morel!"</p>

<p>"Never mind me; if I find it cold by and by, I will
put my jacket on for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" sighed Madeleine. "Ah, as you
say, Heaven is not just! What have we done to be so
wretched, while so many others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Every one has their troubles,&mdash;some more, some
less,&mdash;the great as well as the small."</p>

<p>"Yes; but great people know nothing of the gnawings
of hunger, or the bitter pinching of the cold. Why,
when I look on those diamonds, and remember that the
smallest amongst them would place us and the poor
children in ease and comfort, my heart sickens, and I
ask myself why it is some should have so much, and
others nothing? And what good are these diamonds,
after all, to their owners?"</p>

<p>"Why, if we were to go to the question of what half
the luxuries of life are really good for, we might go
a great way; for instance, what is the good of that
grand gentleman Madame Pipelet calls the commandant
having engaged and furnished the first floor of this
house, when he seldom enters it? What use is it his
having there good beds, and warm covering to them,
since he never sleeps in them?"</p>

<p>"Very true; there is more furniture lying idle there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
than would supply two or three poor families like ours.
And then Madame Pipelet lights a fire every day, to preserve
the things from the damp. Only think of so much
comfortable warmth being lost, while we and the children
are almost frozen to death! But then, you will
say, we are not articles of value; no, indeed, we are
not. Oh, these rich folks, what hard hearts they have!"</p>

<p>"Not harder than other people's, Madeleine; but then,
you see, they do not know what misery or want are.
They are born rich and happy, they live and die so.
How, then, do you expect they can ever think such poor
distressed beings exist in a world which to them is all
happiness? No! I tell you, they have no idea of such
things as fellow creatures toiling beyond their strength
for food, and perishing at last with hunger! How is it
possible for them to imagine privations like ours? The
greater their hunger, the greater enjoyment of their
abundant meal. Is the weather severe, or the cold
intense, they call it a fine frost, a healthful, bracing season.
If they walk out, they return to a glowing, cheerful
fire, which the cold only makes them relish the
more; so that they can scarcely be expected to sympathise
with such as are said to suffer from cold and hunger,
when those two things rather add to than diminish
their pleasure."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor folks are better than rich, since they can
feel for each other, and are always ready and willing to
assist each other as much as lies in their power. Look
at that kind, good Mlle. Rigolette, who has so often sat
up all night, either with me or the children, during our
illness. Why, last night she took Jérome and Pierre
into her room, to share her supper, and it was not
much, either, she had for herself,&mdash;only a cup of milk
and some bread; at her age, all young people have good
appetites, and she must have deprived herself to give to
the children."</p>

<p>"Poor girl! she is indeed most kind,&mdash;and why is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
she so? Because she knows what poverty is. As I
said to you just now, if the rich only knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then that nice-looking lady who came, seeming
so frightened all the while, to ask us if we wanted
anything. Well, now she knows that we do want
everything, will she ever come again, think you?"</p>

<p>"I dare say she will; for, spite of her uneasy and
terrified looks, she seemed very good and kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; if a person be but rich, they are always
right in your opinion. One might almost suppose that
rich folks are made of different materials to poor
creatures like us."</p>

<p>"Stop, wife!" said Morel, gently; "you are getting
on too fast. I did not say that; on the contrary, I
agree that rich people have as many faults as poor ones;
all I mean is, that, unfortunately, they are not aware of
the wretchedness of one-half of the world. Agents in
plenty are employed to hunt out poor wretches who
have committed any crime, but there are no paid agents
to find out half-starving families and honest artisans,
worn-out with toil and privations, who, driven to the
last extremity of distress, are, for want of a little timely
succour, led into sore temptation. It is quite right to
punish evil-doers; it would, perhaps, be better still to
prevent ill deeds. A man may have striven hard
to remain honest for fifty years; but want, misery,
and utter destitution put bad thoughts in his head,
and one rascal more is let loose on the world; whilst
there are many who, if they had but known of his distressed
condition&mdash;However, it is no use talking of
that,&mdash;the world is as it is: I am poor and wretched,
and therefore I speak as I do; were I rich, my talk
would be of fêtes, and happy days, and worldly engagements&mdash;And
how do you find yourself now,
wife?"</p>

<p>"Much the same; I seem to have lost all feeling in
my limbs. But how you shiver! Here, take your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
jacket, and pray put it on. Blow out that candle,
which is burning uselessly,&mdash;see, it is nearly day!"</p>

<p>And, true enough, a faint, glimmering light began to
struggle through the snow with which the skylight was
encumbered, and cast a dismal ray on the interior of
this deplorable human abode, rendering its squalidness
still more apparent; the shade of night had at least
concealed a part of its horrors.</p>

<p>"I shall wait now for the daylight before I go back
to work," said the lapidary, seating himself beside his
wife's <i>paillasse</i>, and leaning his forehead upon his two
hands.</p>

<p>After a short interval of silence, Madeleine said:</p>

<p>"When is Madame Mathieu to come for the stones
you are at work upon?"</p>

<p>"This morning. I have only the side of one false
diamond to polish."</p>

<p>"A false diamond! How is that?&mdash;you who only
make up real stones, whatever the people in the house
may believe."</p>

<p>"Don't you know? But I forgot, you were asleep the
other day when Madame Mathieu came about them.
Well, then, she brought me ten false diamonds&mdash;Rhine
crystals&mdash;to cut exactly to the same size and form as
the like number of real diamonds she also brought.
There, those are them mixed with the rubies on my
table. I think I never saw more splendid stones, or of
purer water, than those ten diamonds, which must, at
least, be worth 60,000 francs."</p>

<p>"And why did she wish them imitated?"</p>

<p>"Because a great lady to whom they belonged&mdash;a
duchess, I think she said&mdash;had given directions to M.
Baudoin, the jeweller, to dispose of her set of diamonds,
and to make her one of false stones to replace it.
Madame Mathieu, who matches stones for M. Baudoin,
explained this to me, when she gave me the real diamonds,
in order that I might be quite sure to cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
false ones to precisely the same size and form. Madame
Mathieu gave a similar job to four other lapidaries, for
there are from forty to fifty stones to cut; and I could
not do them all, as they were required by this morning,
because M. Baudoin must have time to set the false
gems. Madame Mathieu says that grand ladies, very
frequently unknown to anybody but the jeweller, sell
their valuable diamonds, and replace them with Rhenish
crystals."</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see, the mock stones look every bit
as well as the real stones? Yet great ladies, who only
use such things as ornaments, would never think of
sacrificing one of their diamonds to relieve the distress
of such unfortunate beings as we are."</p>

<p>"Come, come, wife! Be more reasonable than this;
sorrow makes you unjust. Who do you think knows
that such people as Morel and his family are in existence,
still less that they are in want?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a man you are, Morel! I really believe, if
any one were to cut you in pieces, that, while they were
doing it, you would try to say, 'Thank you!'"</p>

<p>Morel compassionately shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"And how much will Madame Mathieu owe you this
morning?" asked Madeleine.</p>

<p>"Nothing; because you know I have already had an
advance of 120 francs."</p>

<p>"Nothing! Why, our last sou went the day before
yesterday. We have not a single farthing belonging
to us!"</p>

<p>"Alas, no!" cried Morel, with a dejected air.</p>

<p>"Well, then, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>"The baker refuses to let us have anything more on
credit,&mdash;will he?"</p>

<p>"No; and I was obliged yesterday to beg Madame
Pipelet to lend me part of a loaf."</p>

<p>"Can we borrow anything more of Mother Burette?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has already every article belonging to us in
pledge. What have we to offer her to lend more
money on,&mdash;our children?" asked Morel, with a smile
of bitterness.</p>

<p>"But yourself, my mother, and all the children had
but part of a loaf among you all yesterday. You cannot
go on in this way; you will be starved to death. It is
all your fault that we are not on the books of the charitable
institution this year."</p>

<p>"They will not admit any persons without they possess
furniture, or some such property; and you know
we have nothing in the world. We are looked upon as
though we lived in furnished apartments, and, consequently,
ineligible. Just the same if we tried to get
into any asylum, the children are required to have at
least a blouse, while our poor things have only rags.
Then, as to the charitable societies, one must go backwards
and forwards twenty times before we should
obtain relief; and then what would it be? Why, a loaf
once a month, and half a pound of meat once a fortnight.<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
I should lose more time than it would be
worth."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_5" id="Footnote_2_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Such is the ordinary allowance made at charitable societies, in consequence
of the vast number of applicants for relief.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"But, still, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the lady who came yesterday will not forget
us!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But don't you think Madame Mathieu
would lend us four or five francs, just to keep us from
starving? You have worked for her upwards of ten
years; and surely she will not see an honest workman
like you, burthened with a large and sickly family, perish
for want of a little assistance like that?"</p>

<p>"I do not think it is in her power to aid us. She did
all in her power when she advanced me little by little
120 francs. That is a large sum for her. Because she
buys diamonds, and has sometimes 50,000 francs in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
reticule, she is not the more rich for that. If she gains
100 francs a month, she is well content, for she has
heavy expenses,&mdash;two nieces to bring up; and five
francs is as much to her as it would be to me. There
are times when one does not possess that sum, you know;
and being already so deeply in her debt, I could not ask
her to take bread from her own mouth and that of her
family to give it to me."</p>

<p>"This comes of working for mere agents in jewelry,
instead of procuring employment from first-hand master
jewellers. They are sometimes less particular. But you
are such a poor, easy creature, you would almost let any
one take the eyes out of your head. It is all your fault
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My fault!" exclaimed the unhappy man, exasperated
by this absurd reproach. "Was it or was it not your
mother who occasioned all our misfortunes, by compelling
me to make good the price of the diamond she lost?
But for that we should be beforehand with the world;
we should receive the amount of my daily earnings; we
should have the 1,100 francs in our possession we were
obliged to draw out of the savings-bank to put to the
1,300 francs lent us by M. Jacques Ferrand. May every
curse light on him!"</p>

<p>"And you still persist in not asking him to help you?
Certainly he is so stingy that I daresay he would do
nothing for you; but then it is right to try. You cannot
know without you do try."</p>

<p>"Ask him to help me!" cried Morel. "Ask him! I
had rather be burnt before a slow fire. Hark ye, Madeleine!
Unless you wish to drive me mad, mention that
man's name no more to me."</p>

<p>As he uttered these words, the usually mild, resigned
expression of the lapidary's countenance was exchanged
for a look of gloomy energy, while a slight suffusion coloured
the ordinarily pale features of the agitated man, as,
rising abruptly from the pallet beside which he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
sitting, he began to pace the miserable apartment with
hurried steps; and, spite of the deformed and attenuated
appearance of poor Morel, his attitude and action bespoke
the noblest, purest indignation.</p>

<p>"I am not ill-disposed towards any man," cried he, at
length, pausing of a sudden; "and never, to my knowledge,
harmed a human being. But, I tell you, when I
think of this notary, I wish him&mdash;ah! I wish him&mdash;as
much wretchedness as he has caused me." Then pressing
both hands to his forehead, he murmured, in a mournful
tone: "Just God! what crime have I committed that
a hard fate should deliver me and mine, tied hand and
foot, into the power of such a hypocrite? Have his
riches been given him only to worry, harass, and destroy
those his bad passions lead him to persecute, injure, and
corrupt?"</p>

<p>"That's right! that's right!" said Madeleine; "go on
abusing him. You will have done yourself a great deal
of good, shall you not, when he puts you in prison, as he
can do any day, for that promissory note of 1,300 francs
on which he obtained judgment against you? He holds
you fast as a bird at the end of a string. I hate this
notary as badly as you do; but since we are so completely
in his power, why you should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him ruin and dishonour my child, I suppose?"
burst from the pale lips of the lapidary, with violent and
impatient energy.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Morel, don't speak so loud; the
children are awake, and will hear you."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" returned Morel, with bitter irony; "it
will serve as a fine example for our two little girls. It
will instruct them to expect that, one of these days, some
villain or other like the notary may take a fancy to them,&mdash;perhaps
the same man; and then, I suppose, you would
tell me, as now, to be careful how I offended him, since
he had me in his power. You say, if I displease him, he
can put me in prison. Now, tell the truth: you advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
me, then, to leave my daughter at his mercy, do you
not?"</p>

<p>And then, passing from the extreme of rage at the
idea of all the wickedness practised by the notary to
tender recollections of his child, the unhappy man burst
into a sort of convulsive weeping, mingled with deep and
heavy sobs, for his kindly nature could not long sustain
the tone of sarcastic indignation he had assumed.</p>

<p>"Oh, my children!" cried he, with bitter grief; "my
poor children! My good, my beautiful, too&mdash;too beautiful
Louise! 'Tis from those rich gifts of nature all
our troubles proceeded. Had you been less lovely, that
man would never have pressed his money upon me. I
am honest and hard-working; and if the jeweller had
given me time, I should never have been under the obligation
to the old monster, of which he avails himself to
seek to dishonour my child. I should not then have left
her a single hour within his power; but I dare not remove
her,&mdash;I dare not! For am I not at his mercy?
Oh, want! oh, misery! What insults do they not make
us endure!"</p>

<p>"But what can you do?" asked Madeleine. "You
know he threatens Louise that if she quits him he will
put you in prison directly."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! He dares address her as though she were
the very vilest of creatures."</p>

<p>"Well, you must not mind that; for should she leave
the notary, there is no doubt he would instantly throw
you into prison, and then what would become of me,
with these five helpless creatures and my mother?
Suppose Louise did earn twenty francs a month in
another place, do you think seven persons can live on
that?"</p>

<p>"And so that we may live, Louise is to be disgraced
and left to ruin?"</p>

<p>"You always make things out worse than they are.
It is true the notary makes offers of love to Louise; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
has told us so repeatedly. But then you know what a
good girl she is; she would never listen to him."</p>

<p>"She is good, indeed; and so right-minded, active, and
industrious! When, seeing how badly we were off in consequence
of your long illness, she insisted upon going to
service that she might not be a burthen to us, did I not
say what it cost me to part with her? To think of my
sweet Louise being subjected to all the harshness and
humiliation of a servant's life,&mdash;she who was naturally so
proud that we used jokingly&mdash;ah, we could joke then!&mdash;to
call her the Princess, because she always said that, by
dint of care and cleanliness, she would make our little
home like a palace! Dear Louise! It would have been
my greatest happiness to have kept her with me, though
I had worked all day and all night too. And when I
saw her blooming face, with her bright eyes glancing at
me as she sat beside my work-table, my labour always
seemed lightened; and when she sung like a bird those
little songs she knew I liked to hear, I used to fancy
myself the happiest father alive. Poor dear Louise!
so hard-working, yet always so gay and lively! Why, she
could even manage your mother, and make her do whatever
she wished. But I defy any one to resist her sweet
words or winning smile. And how she watched over
and waited upon you! What pains she would take to
try and divert you from thinking of what you suffered!
And how tenderly she looked after her little brothers
and sisters, finding time for everything! Ah, with our
Louise all our joy and happiness&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;left us!"</p>

<p>"Don't go on so, Morel. Don't remind me of all
these things, or you will break my heart," cried
Madeleine, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"And, then, when I think that perhaps that old monster&mdash;Do
you know, when that idea flashes across my
brain, my senses seem disturbed, and I have but one
thought, that of first killing him and then killing myself?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would become of all of us if you were to do so?
Besides, I tell you again, you make things worse than
they really are. I dare say the notary was only joking
with Louise. He is such a pious man, and goes so regularly
to mass every Sunday, and only keeps company
with priests folks say. Why, many people think that
he is safer to place money with than the bank itself."</p>

<p>"Well, and what does all that prove? Merely that
he is a rich hypocrite, instead of a poor one. I know
well enough what a good girl Louise is; but then she
loves us so tenderly that it breaks her heart to see the
want and wretchedness we are in. She knows well
enough that if anything were to happen to me you
would all perish with hunger; and by threatening to
put me into prison he might work on the dear child's
mind,&mdash;like a villain as he is,&mdash;and persuade her, on
our account! O, God, my brain burns! I feel as
though I were going mad."</p>

<p>"But, Morel, if ever that were the case, the notary
would be sure to make her a great number of fine presents
or money, and, I am sure, she would not have kept
them all to herself. She would certainly have brought
part to us."</p>

<p>"Silence, woman! Let me hear no more such words
escape your lips. Louise touch the wages of infamy!
My good, my virtuous girl, accept such foul gifts! Oh,
wife!"</p>

<p>"Not for herself, certainly. But to bring to us perhaps
she would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madeleine," exclaimed Morel, excited almost to
frenzy, "again, I say, let me not hear such language
from your lips; you make me shudder. Heaven only
knows what you and the children also would become
were I taken away, if such are your principles."</p>

<p>"Why, what harm did I say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none."</p>

<p>"Then what makes you uneasy about Louise?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The lapidary impatiently interrupted his wife by
saying:</p>

<p>"Because I have noticed for the last three months
that, whenever Louise comes to see us, she seems embarrassed,
and even confused. When I take her in my
arms and embrace her, as I have been used to do from
her birth, she blushes."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is with delight at seeing you, or from
shame."</p>

<p>"She seems sadder and more dejected, too, each visit
she pays us."</p>

<p>"Because she finds our misery constantly increasing.
Besides, when I spoke to her concerning the notary, she
told me he had quite ceased his threats of putting you in
prison."</p>

<p>"But did she tell you the price she has paid to induce
him to lay aside his threats? She did not tell you that,
I dare say, did she? Ah, a father's eye is not to be
deceived; and her blushes and embarrassments, when
giving me her usual kiss, make me dread I know not
what. Why, would it not be an atrocious thing to say
to a poor girl, whose bread depended on her employer's
word, 'Either sacrifice your virtuous principles, and become
what I would have you, or quit my house? And
if any one should inquire of me respecting the character
you have with me, I shall speak of you in such terms
that no one will take you into their service.' Well,
then, how much worse is it to frighten a fond and affectionate
child into surrendering her innocence, by threatening
to put her father into prison if she refused, when
the brute knows that upon the labour of that father a
whole family depends? Surely the earth contains
nothing more infamous, more fiendlike, than such conduct."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Madeleine, "and then only to think that
with the value of one, only one of those diamonds now
lying on your table, we might pay the notary all we owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
him, and so take Louise out of his power and keep her
at home with us. Don't you see, husband?"</p>

<p>"What is the use of your repeating the same thing
over and over again? You might just as well tell me
that if I were rich I should not be poor," answered
Morel, with sorrowful impatience. For such was the
innate and almost constitutional honesty of this man,
that it never once occurred to him that his weak-minded
partner, bowed down and irritated by long suffering and
want, could ever have conceived the idea of tempting him
to a dishonourable appropriation of that which belonged
to another.</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh, the unfortunate man resigned himself
to his hard fate. "Thrice happy those parents who
can retain their innocent children beneath the paternal
roof, and defend them from the thousand snares laid to
entrap their unsuspecting youth. But who is there to
watch over the safety of the poor girl condemned at an
early age to seek employment from home? Alas, no one!
Directly she is capable of adding her mite to the family
earnings, she leaves her dwelling at an early hour, and
repairs to the manufactory where she may happen to be
engaged. Meanwhile, both father and mother are too
busily employed to have leisure to attend to their daughter's
comings or goings. 'Our time is our stock in
trade,' cry they, 'and bread is too dear to enable us to
lay aside our work while we look after our children.'
And then there is an outcry raised as to the quantity of
depraved females constantly to be met with, and of the
impropriety of conduct among those of the lower orders,
wholly forgetting that the parents have neither the means
of keeping them at home, nor of watching over their
morals when away from them."</p>

<p>Thus mentally moralised Morel. Then, speaking
aloud, he added:</p>

<p>"After all, our greatest privation is when forced to
quit our parents, wives, or children. It is to the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
that family affection is most comforting and beneficial.
Yet, directly our children grow up, and are capable of
becoming our dearest companions, we are forced to part
with them."</p>

<p>At this moment some one knocked loudly at the door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h5>JUDGMENT AND EXECUTION.</h5>


<p>The lapidary, much astonished, rose and opened
the door. Two men entered the garret. One, tall,
lanky, with an ill-favoured and pimply face, shaded by
thick grizzly whiskers, held in his hand a thick cane,
loaded at the head; he wore a battered hat, and a long-tailed
and bespattered green coat, buttoned up close to
his throat. Above the threadbare velvet collar was displayed
his long neck, red and bald like that of a vulture.
This man's name was Malicorne. The other was a
shorter man, with a look as low-lived, and red, fat,
puffed features, dressed with a great effort at ridiculous
splendour. Shiny buttons were in the folds of the front
of his shirt, whose cleanliness was most suspicious, and
a long chain of mosaic gold serpentined down a faded
plaid waistcoat, which was seen beneath his seedy Chesterfield,
of a yellowish gray colour. This gentleman's
name was Bourdin.</p>

<p>"How poverty-stricken this hole smells," said Malicorne,
pausing on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Why, it does not scent of lavender-water. Confound
it, but we have a lowish customer to deal with," responded
Bourdin, with a gesture of disgust and contempt,
and then advanced towards the artisan, who was
looking at him with as much surprise as indignation.</p>

<p>Through the door, left a little ajar, might be seen the
villainous, watchful, and cunning face of the young scamp
Tortillard, who, having followed these strangers unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to them, was sneaking after, spying, and listening to
them.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" inquired the lapidary, abruptly,
disgusted at the coarseness of these fellows.</p>

<p>"Jérome Morel?" said Bourdin.</p>

<p>"I am he!"</p>

<p>"Working lapidary?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. But you are troublesome, so tell me at
once your business, or leave the room."</p>

<p>"Really, your politeness is remarkable! Much obliged!
I say, Malicorne," said the man, turning to his comrade,
"there's not so much fat to cut at here as there was at
that 'ere Viscount de Saint-Rémy's."</p>

<p>"I believe you; but when there is fat, why the door's
kept shut in your face, as we found in the Rue de
Chaillot. The bird had hopped the twig, and precious
quick, too, whilst such vermin as these hold on to their
cribs like a snail to his shell."</p>

<p>"I believe you; well, the stone jug just suits such
individuals."</p>

<p>"The sufferer (creditor) must be a good fellow, for it
will cost him more than it's worth; but that's his
lookout."</p>

<p>"If," said Morel, angrily, "you were not drunk, as
you seem to be, I should be angry with you. Leave this
apartment instantly!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! He's a fine fellow with his elegant curve,"
said Bourdin, making an insulting allusion to the contorted
figure of the poor lapidary. "I say, Malicorne,
he has cheek enough to call this an apartment,&mdash;a hole
in which I would not put my dog."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" exclaimed Madeleine, who
had been so frightened that she could not say a word
before. "Call for assistance; perhaps they are rogues.
Take care of your diamonds!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>And, seeing these two ill-looking strangers come closer
to his working-bench, on which his precious stones were
still lying, Morel, fearful of some evil intentions, ran
towards the table, and covered the jewels with his two
hands.</p>

<p>Tortillard, still on the watch, caught at Madeleine's
words, observed the movement of the artisan, and said
to himself:</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! So they said he was a lapidary of
sham stones; if they were mock he would not be afraid
of being robbed; this is a good thing to know. So
Mother Mathieu, who comes here so often, is a matcher
of <i>real</i> stones, after all, and has real diamonds in her
basket; this is a good thing to know, and I'll tell the
Chouette," added Bras Rouge's brat.</p>

<p>"If you do not leave this room, I will call in the
guard," said Morel.</p>

<p>The children, alarmed at this scene, began to cry, and
the idiotic mother sat up in her bed.</p>

<p>"If any one has a right to call for the guard, it is we,
you Mister Twistabout," said Bourdin.</p>

<p>"And the guard would lend us a hand to carry you
off to gaol if you resist," added Malicorne. "We have
not the magistrate with us, it is true; but if you have
any wish for his company, we'll find you one, just
out of bed, hot and heavy; Bourdin will go and fetch
him."</p>

<p>"To prison! me?" exclaimed Morel, struck with
dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, to Clichy."</p>

<p>"To Clichy?" repeated the artisan, with an air of
despair.</p>

<p>"It seems a hardish pill," said Malicorne.</p>

<p>"Well, then, to the debtors' jail, if you like that
better," said Bourdin.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;what&mdash;indeed&mdash;why&mdash;the notary&mdash;ah,
<i>mon Dieu!</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>And the workman, pale as death, fell on his stool,
unable to add another word.</p>

<p>"We are bound bailiffs, come to lay hold of you;
now are you fly?"</p>

<p>"Morel, it is the note of Louise's master! We are
undone!" exclaimed Madeleine, in a tone of agony.</p>

<p>"Hear the judgment," said Malicorne, taking from
his dirty and crammed pocketbook a stamped writ.</p>

<p>After having skimmed over, according to custom, a
part of this document in an unintelligible tone, he distinctly
articulated the last words, which were, unfortunately,
but too important to the artisan:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Judgment finally given. The Tribunal condemns Jérome
Morel to pay to Pierre Petit-Jean, merchant,<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by every available
means, even to the arrest of body, the sum of 1,300 francs, with
interest from the day of protest, and to pay all other and extra
costs. Given and judged at Paris, 13 September, etc., etc."</p></div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The cunning notary, unable to prosecute in his own name, had made the
unfortunate Morel give a blank acceptance, and had filled up the note of
hand with the name of a third party.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And Louise! Louise!" cried Morel, almost distracted
in his brain, and apparently unheeding the long preamble
which had just been read. "Where is Louise, then,
for, doubtless, she has quitted the notary, since he sends
me to prison? My child! My Louise! What has become
of you?"</p>

<p>"Who the devil is Louise?" asked Bourdin.</p>

<p>"Let him alone!" replied Malicorne, brutally; "don't
you see the respectable old twaddler is not right in his
nonsense-box?" Then, approaching Morel, he added:
"I say, my fine fellow, right about file! March on!
Let us get out of here, will you, and have a little fresh
air. You stink enough to poison a cat in this here
hole!"</p>

<p>"Morel!" shrieked Madeleine, wildly, "don't go!
Kill those wretches! Oh, you coward, not to knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
them down! What! are you going to let them take
you away? Are you going to abandon us all?"</p>

<p>"Pray don't put yourself out of the way, ma'am,"
said Bourdin, with an ironical grin. "I've only just
got to remark that if your good man lays his little
finger on me, why I'll make him remember it," continued
he, swinging his loaded stick round and round.</p>

<p>Entirely occupied with thoughts of Louise, Morel
scarcely heard a word of what was passing. All at
once an expression of bitter satisfaction passed over
his countenance, as he said:</p>

<p>"Louise has doubtless left the notary's house; now
I shall go to prison willingly." Then, casting a troubled
look around him, he exclaimed: "But my wife! Her
mother! The children! Who will provide for them?
No one will trust me with stones to work at in prison,
for it will be supposed my bad conduct has sent me
there. Does this hard-hearted notary wish the destruction
of myself and all my family also?"</p>

<p>"Once, twice, old chap," said Bourdin, "will you
stop your gammon? You are enough to bore a man
to death. Come, put on your things, and let us be off."</p>

<p>"Good gentlemen, kind gentlemen," cried Madeleine,
from her sick-bed, "pray forgive what I said just now!
Surely you will not be so cruel as to take my husband
away; what will become of me and my five poor children,
and my old mother, who is an idiot? There she
lies; you see her, poor old creature, huddled up on her
mattress; she is quite out of her senses, my good
gentlemen; she is, indeed, quite mad!"</p>

<p>"La! what, that old bald-headed thing a woman?
Well, hang me if that ain't enough to astonish a man!"</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if it isn't, then!" cried the other
bailiff, bursting into a horse-laugh; "why, I took it for
something tied up in an old sack. Look! her old head
is shaved quite close; it seems as though she had got a
white skull-cap on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go, children, and kneel down, and beg of these
good gentlemen not to take away your poor father, our
only support," said Madeleine, anxious by a last effort
to touch the hearts of the bailiffs. But, spite of their
mother's orders, the terrified children remained weeping
on their miserable mattress.</p>

<p>At the unusual noise which prevailed, added to the
aspect of two strange men in the room, the poor idiot
turned herself towards the wall, as though striving to
hide from them, uttering all the time the most discordant
cries and moans. Morel, meanwhile, appeared unconscious
of all that was going on; this last stroke of
fate had been so frightful and unexpected, and the consequences
of his arrest were so dreadful, that his mind
seemed almost unequal to understanding its reality.
Worn out by all manner of privations, and exhausted
by over-toil, his strength utterly forsook him, and he
remained seated on his stool, pale and haggard, and as
though incapable of speech or motion, his head drooping
on his breast, and his arms hanging listlessly by his
side.</p>

<p>"Deuce take me," cried Malicorne, "if that old patterer
is not going fast asleep! Why, I say, my chap,
you seem to think nothing of keeping gen'l'men like us
waiting; just remember, will you, our time is precious!
You know this is not exactly a party of pleasure, so
march, or I shall be obliged to make you."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, the man grasped the
artisan by the shoulder, and shook him roughly; which
so alarmed the children, that, unable to restrain their
terror, the three little boys emerged from their <i>paillasse</i>,
and, half naked as they were, came in an agony of tears
to throw themselves at the feet of the bailiffs, holding
up their clasped hands, and crying, in tones of touching
earnestness:</p>

<p>"Pray, pray don't hurt our dear father!"</p>

<p>At the sight of these poor, shivering, half-clad infants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
weeping with affright, and trembling with cold, Bourdin,
spite of his natural callousness and long acquaintance
with scenes of this sort, could not avoid a feeling almost
resembling compassion from stealing over him, while his
pitiless companion, brutally disengaging himself from
the grasp of the small, weak creatures who were clinging
to him, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hands off, you young ragamuffins! A devilish fine
trade ours would be, if we were to allow ourselves to be
mauled about by a set of beggars' brats like you!"</p>

<p>As though the scene were not sufficiently distressing,
a fearful addition was made to its horrors. The eldest
of the little girls, who had remained in the <i>paillasse</i> with
her sick sister, suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mother! mother! I don't know what's the matter
with Adèle! She is so cold, and her eyes are fixed on
my face, and yet she does not breathe."</p>

<p>The poor little child, whose consumptive appearance
we have before noticed, had expired gently, and without
a sigh, her looks fixed earnestly on the sister she so
tenderly loved.</p>

<p>No language can describe the cry which burst from
the lips of the lapidary's wife at these words, which at
once revealed the dreadful truth; it was one of those
wild, despairing, convulsive shrieks, which seem to sever
the very heart-strings of a mother.</p>

<p>"My poor little sister looks as though she were dead!"
continued the child; "she frightens me, with her eyes
fixed on me, and her face so cold!"</p>

<p>Saying which, in an agony of terror, she leaped from
beside the corpse of the infant, and ran to shelter herself
in her mother's arms, while the distracted parent, forgetting
that her almost paralysed limbs were incapable
of supporting her, made a violent effort to rise and go to
the assistance of her child, whom she could not believe
was actually past recovery; but her strength failed her,
and with a deep sigh of despair she sunk upon the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
That cry found an echo in the heart of Morel, and
roused him from his stupor. He sprang with one bound
to the <i>paillasse</i>, and withdrew from it the stiffened form
of an infant four years old, dead and cold. Want and
misery had accelerated its end, although its complaint,
which had originated in the positive want of common
necessaries, was beyond the reach of any human aid to
remove. Its poor little limbs were already rigid with
death. Morel, whose very hair seemed to stand on end
with despair and terror, stood holding his dead child in
his arms, motionlessly contemplating its thin features
with a fixed bloodshot gaze, though no tear moistened
his dry, burning eyeballs.</p>

<p>"Morel! Morel, give Adèle to me!" cried the unhappy
mother, extending her arms towards him; "she is not
dead,&mdash;it is not possible! Let me have her, and I shall
be able to warm her in my arms."</p>

<p>The curiosity of the idiot was excited by observing
the pertinacity with which the bailiffs kept close to the
lapidary, who would not part with the body of his child.
She ceased her yells and cries, and, rising from her
mattress, approached gently, protruded her hideous,
senseless countenance over Morel's shoulder, staring in
vacant wonder at the pale corpse of her grandchild, the
features of the idiot retaining their usual expression of
stupid sullenness. At the end of a few minutes, she
uttered a sort of horrible yawning noise, almost resembling
the roar of a famished animal; then, hurrying back
to her mattress, she threw herself upon it, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Hungry! hungry! hungry!"</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the poor, half-crazed artisan,
with haggard looks, "you see all that is left me of my
poor child, my Adèle,&mdash;we called her Adèle, she was
so pretty she deserved a pretty name; and she was just
four years old last night. Ay, and this morning even I
kissed her, and she put her little arms about my neck
and embraced me,&mdash;oh, so fondly! And now, you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
gentlemen, perhaps you will tell me there is one mouth
less to feed, and that I am lucky to get rid of one,&mdash;you
think so, don't you?"</p>

<p>The unfortunate man's reason was fast giving way
under the many shocks he had received.</p>

<p>"Morel," cried Madeleine, "give me my child! I will
have her!"</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied the lapidary; "that is only fair.
Everybody ought to secure their own happiness!" So
saying, he laid the child in its mother's arms, and uttering
a groan, such as comes only from a breaking heart,
he covered his face with his hands; while Madeleine,
almost as frenzied as her husband, placed the body of
her child amid the straw of her wretched bed, watching
it with frantic jealousy, while the other children, kneeling
around her, filled the air with their wailings.</p>

<p>The bailiffs, who had experienced a temporary feeling
of compassion at the death of the child, soon fell back
into their accustomed brutality.</p>

<p>"I say, friend," said Malicorne to the lapidary, "your
child is dead, and there's an end of it! I dare say you
think it a misfortune; but then, you see, we are all
mortal, and neither we nor you can bring it back to life.
So come along with us; for, to tell you the truth, we're
upon the scent of a spicy one we must nab to-day. So
don't delay us, that's a trump!"</p>

<p>But Morel heard not a word he said. Entirely preoccupied
with his own sad thoughts, the bewildered man
kept up a kind of wandering delivery of his own afflicting
ideas.</p>

<p>"My poor Adèle!" murmured he; "we must now see
about laying you in the grave, and watching by her little
corpse till the people come to carry it to its last home,&mdash;to
lay it in the ground. But how are we to do that
without a coffin,&mdash;and where shall we get one? Who
will give me credit for one? Oh, a very small coffin will
do,&mdash;only for a little creature of four years of age! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
we shall want no bearers! Oh, no, I can carry it under
my arm. Ha! ha! ha!" added he, with a burst of
frightful mirth; "what a good thing it is she did not live
to be as old as Louise! I never could have persuaded
anybody to trust me for a coffin large enough for a girl
of eighteen years of age."</p>

<p>"I say, just look at that chap!" said Bourdin to
Malicorne. "I'll be dashed if I don't think as he's
a-going mad, like the old woman there! Only see how
he rolls his eyes about,&mdash;enough to frighten one! Come,
I say, let's make haste and be off. Only hark, how that
idiot creature is a-roaring for something to eat! Well,
they are rum customers, from beginning to end!"</p>

<p>"We must get done with them as soon as we can.
Although the law only allows us seventy-six francs,
seventy-five centièmes, for arresting this beggar, yet, in
justice to ourselves, we must swell the costs to two hundred
and forty or two hundred and fifty francs. You
know the sufferer (the creditor) pays us!"</p>

<p>"You mean, advances the cash. Old Gaffer there
will have to pay the piper, since he must dance to the
music."</p>

<p>"Well, by the time he has paid his creditor 2,500
francs for debt, interest, and expenses, etc., he'll find it
pretty warm work."</p>

<p>"A devilish sight more than we do our job up here!
I'm a'most frost-bitten!" cried the bailiff, blowing the
ends of his fingers. "Come, old fellow, make haste, will
you! Just look sharp! You can snivel, you know, as
we go along. Why, how the devil can we help it, if
your brat has kicked the bucket?"</p>

<p>"These beggars always have such a lot of children, if
they have nothing else!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so they have," responded Malicorne. Then,
slapping Morel on the shoulder, he called out in a loud
voice, "I tell you what it is, my friend, we're not going
to be kept dawdling here all day,&mdash;our time is precious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
So either out with the stumpy, or march off to prison,
without any more bother!"</p>

<p>"Prison!" exclaimed a clear, youthful voice; "take
M. Morel to prison!" and a bright, beaming face
appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mlle. Rigolette," cried the weeping children,
as they recognised the happy, healthful countenance of
their young protectress and friend, "these wicked men
are going to take our poor father away, and put him in
prison! And sister Adèle is just dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried the kind-hearted girl, her dark eyes
filling with compassionating tears; "poor little thing!
But it cannot be true that your father is in danger of
a prison;" and, almost stupefied with surprise, she
gazed alternately from the children to Morel, and from
him to the bailiffs.</p>

<p>"I say, my girl," said Bourdin, approaching Rigolette,
"as you do seem to have the use of your senses, just
make this good man hear reason, will you? His child
has just died. Well, that can't be helped now; but, you
see, he is a-keeping of us, because we're a-waiting to take
him to the debtors' prison, being sheriffs' officers, duly
sworn in and appointed. Tell him so!"</p>

<p>"Then it is true!" exclaimed the feeling girl.</p>

<p>"True? I should say it was and no mistake! Now,
don't you see, while the mother is busy with the dead
babby&mdash;and, bless you! she's got it there, hugging it up
in bed, and won't part with it!&mdash;she won't notice us?
So I want the father to be off while she isn't thinking
nothing about it!"</p>

<p>"Good God! Good God!" replied Rigolette, in deep
distress; "what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Done? Why, pay the money, or go to prison! There
is nothing between them two ways. If you happen to
have two or three thousand francs by you you can oblige
him with, why, shell out, and we'll be off, and glad
enough to be gone!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you," cried Rigolette, "be so barbarous as
to make a jest of such distress as this?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," rejoined the other man, "all joking
apart, if you really do wish to be useful, try to prevent
the woman from seeing us take her husband away. You
will spare them both a very disagreeable ten minutes!"</p>

<p>Coarse as was this counsel, it was not destitute of
good sense; and Rigolette, feeling she could do nothing
else, approached the bedside of Madeleine, who, distracted
by her grief, appeared unconscious of the
presence of Rigolette, as, gathering the children together,
she knelt with them beside their afflicted mother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Morel, upon recovering from his temporary
wildness, had sunk into a state of deep and bitter reflections
upon his present position, which, now that his
mind saw things through a calmer medium, only increased
the poignancy of his sufferings. Since the
notary had proceeded to such extremities, any hope
from his mercy was vain. He felt there was nothing
left but to submit to his fate, and let the law take its
course.</p>

<p>"Are we ever to get off?" inquired Bourdin. "I tell
you what, my man, if you are not for marching, we must
make you, that's all."</p>

<p>"I cannot leave these diamonds about in this manner,&mdash;my
wife is half distracted," cried Morel, pointing to
the stones lying on his work-table. "The person for
whom I am polishing them will come to fetch them
away either this morning or during the day. They are
of considerable value."</p>

<p>"Capital!" whispered Tortillard, who was still peeping
in at the half closed door; "capital, capital! What
will Mother Chouette say when I tell her this bit of
luck?"</p>

<p>"Only give me till to-morrow," said Morel, beseechingly;
"only till I can return these diamonds to my
employer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, the thing can't be done. So let's have no
more to say about it."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible for me to leave diamonds of
such value as these exposed, to be lost or even stolen in
my absence."</p>

<p>"Well, then, take them along with you. We have got
a coach waiting below, for which you will have to pay
when you settle the costs. We will go all together to your
employer's house, and, if you don't meet with him, why,
then, you can deposit these jewels at the office of the
prison, where they will be as safe as in the bank;
only look sharp, and let's be off before your wife and
children perceive us."</p>

<p>"Give me but till to-morrow,&mdash;only to bury my
child!" implored Morel, in a supplicating voice, half
stifled by the heavy sobs he strove in vain to repress.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, I tell you; why, we have lost an hour
here already!"</p>

<p>"Besides, it's dull work going to berrins," chimed in
Malicorne. "It would be too much for your feelings,
p'raps."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Morel, bitterly; "it is dull work to see
what we would have given our lives to save laid in the
cold earth. But, as you are men, grant me that satisfaction."
Then, looking up, and observing the nonchalant
air with which his prayer was received, he
added, "But no, persons of so much feeling as you
are would fear to indulge me, lest I should find it a
gloomy sight. Well, then, at least grant me one word!"</p>

<p>"The deuce take your last words! Why, old chap,
there seems no end to them. Come, put the steam on;
make haste," said Malicorne, with brutal impatience, "or
we shall lose t'other gent we're after."</p>

<p>"When did you receive orders to arrest me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why, judgment was signed four months ago! But
it was only yesterday our officer got instructions to put
it in execution."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only yesterday! And why has it been delayed so
long?"</p>

<p>"How the devil should I know? Come, look about
you, and put up your things."</p>

<p>"Only yesterday? And during the whole day we saw
nothing of Louise! Where can she be? Or what has
become of her?" inquired the lapidary mentally, as he
took from his table a small box filled with cotton, in
which he placed his stones. "But never mind all that
now. I shall have plenty of time to think about it when
I am in prison."</p>

<p>"Come, look sharp there a bit. Tie up your things to
take with you, and put your clothes on, there's a fine
fellow!"</p>

<p>"I have no clothes to tie up, and have nothing whatever
to take with me except these jewels, that I may
deposit them at the office of the prison."</p>

<p>"Well, then, dress yourself as quick as you can."</p>

<p>"I have no other dress than that you now see me in."</p>

<p>"I say, mate," cried Bourdin, "does he really mean to
be seen in our company with such rags as those on?"</p>

<p>"I fear, indeed, I shall shame such gentlemen as you
are!" said Morel, bitterly.</p>

<p>"It don't much signify," replied Malicorne, "as
nobody will see us in the coach."</p>

<p>"Father!" cried one of the children, "mother is
calling for you!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me!" said Morel, addressing one of the
men with hurried tones; "if one spark of human pity
dwells within you, grant me one favour! I have not the
courage to bid my wife and children farewell; it would
break my heart! And if they see you take me away,
they will try to follow me. I wish to spare all this.
Therefore, I beseech you to say, in a loud voice, that you
will come again in three or four days, and pretend to go
away. You can wait for me at the next landing-place,
and I will come to you in less than five minutes; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
will spare all the misery of taking leave. I am quite
sure it would be too much for me, and that I should
become mad! I was not far off it a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Not to be caught!" answered Malicorne; "you want
to do me! But I'm up to you! You mean to give us
the slip, you old chouse!"</p>

<p>"God of heaven!" cried Morel, with a mixture of
grief and indignation, "has it come to this?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he means what you say," whispered
Bourdin to his companion; "let us do what he asks; we
shall never get away unless we do. I'll stand outside
the door; there is no other way of escaping from this
garret; he cannot get away from us."</p>

<p>"Very well. But what a dog-hole! What a place
for a man to care about leaving! Why, a prison will be
a palace to it!" Then, addressing Morel, he said, "Now,
then, be quick, and we will wait for you on the next
landing; so make up some pretence for our going."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bourdin in a loud voice, and bestowing
a significant look on the unhappy artisan, "since
things are as you say, and as you think you shall be able
to pay us in a short time, why, we shall leave you for
the present, and return in about four or five days; but
you must not disappoint us then, remember!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen. I have no doubt I shall be
able to pay you then."</p>

<p>The bailiffs then withdrew, while Tortillard, hearing
the men talk of quitting the room, had hastened down-stairs
for fear of being detected listening.</p>

<p>"There, Madame Morel!" said Rigolette, endeavouring
to draw the wife of the lapidary from the state of
gloomy abstraction into which she had fallen, "do you
hear that? The men have gone, and left your husband
undisturbed."</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!" exclaimed the children, joyfully,
"they have not taken father away!"</p>

<p>"Morel, Morel!" murmured Madeleine, her brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
quite turned, "take one of those diamonds&mdash;take the
largest&mdash;and sell it; no one will know it, and then we
shall be delivered from our misery; poor little Adèle
will get warm then, and come back to us."</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the instant when no one was observing
him, the lapidary profited by it to steal from the
room. One of the men was waiting for him on the little
landing-place, which was also covered only by the roof;
on this small spot opened the door of a garret, which adjoined
the apartment occupied by the Morels, and in which
M. Pipelet kept his dépôt of leather; and, further, this
little angular recess, in which a person could not stand
upright, was dignified by the melancholy porter with the
name of his Melodramatic Cabinet, because, by means of
a hole between the lath and plaster, he frequently indulged
in the luxury of woe by witnessing the many
touching scenes occasioned by the distress of the wretched
family who dwelt in the garret beyond it. This door had
not escaped the lynx eye of the bailiff, who had, for a
time, suspected his prisoner of intending either to escape
or conceal himself by means of it.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let us make a start of it!" cried he, beginning
to descend the stairs as Morel emerged from the
garret. "Rather a ragged recruit to march with,"
added he, beckoning to the lapidary to follow him.</p>

<p>"Only an instant, one single instant, for the love of
God!" exclaimed Morel, as, kneeling down, he cast a
last look on his wife and children through a chink in the
door. Then clasping his hands, he said, in a low, heart-broken
voice, while bitter tears flowed down his haggard
cheeks:</p>

<p>"Adieu, my poor children! my wife! May Heaven
preserve you all! Farewell, farewell!"</p>

<p>"Come, don't get preaching!" said Bourdin, coarsely,
"or your sermons may keep us here till night, which is
what I can't stand, for I am almost froze to death as it
is. Ugh! what a kennel! what a hole!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>Morel rose from his knees and was about to follow the
bailiff, when the words, "Father! father!" sounded up
the staircase.</p>

<p>"Louise!" exclaimed the lapidary, raising his hands
towards heaven in a transport of gratitude; "thank God
I shall be able to embrace you before I go!"</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised, I am here in time!" cried the
voice, as it rapidly approached, and quick, light steps
were distinguishable, swiftly ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy, my dear," said a second voice, evidently
proceeding from some individual considerably
behind the first speaker, but whose thick puffing and
laborious breathing announced the coming of one who
did not find mounting to the top of the house so easy
an affair as it seemed to her light-footed companion.</p>

<p>The reader may, perhaps, have already guessed that
the last comer was no other than Madame Pipelet, who,
less agile than Louise, was compelled to advance at a
much slower pace.</p>

<p>"Louise! Is it, indeed, you, my own, my good Louise?"
said Morel, still weeping. "But how pale you look!
For mercy's sake, my child, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, father, nothing, I assure you!" said Louise,
in much agitation; "but I have run so fast! See, I
have brought the money!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You are free!"</p>

<p>"You knew, then, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Here, sir, you will find it quite right,"
said the poor girl, placing the rouleau of gold in the
hands of Malicorne.</p>

<p>"But this money, Louise,&mdash;how did you become possessed
of it?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it by and by; pray do not
be uneasy; let us go and comfort my mother. Come,
father."</p>

<p>"No, not just this minute!" cried Morel, remembering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
that, as yet, Louise was entirely ignorant of the death of
her little sister; "wait an instant. I have something to
say to you first. But about this money?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Malicorne, as, having finished counting
the gold, he put it in his pocket; "precisely one thousand
three hundred francs. And is that all you have got
for me, my pretty dear?"</p>

<p>"I thought, father," said Louise, struck with alarm
and surprise at the man's question, "that you only owed
one thousand three hundred francs."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," replied Morel.</p>

<p>"Precisely so!" answered the bailiff; "the original
debt is one thousand three hundred francs; well, that is
all right now, and we may put 'settled' against that:
but then, you see, there are the costs, caption, etc.,
amounting to eleven hundred and forty francs, still to be
paid."</p>

<p>"Gracious heavens!" cried Louise, "I thought one
thousand three hundred francs would pay everything!
But, sir, we will make up the money, and bring it to you
very soon; take this for the present, it is a good sum;
take it as paid on account; it will go towards the debt,
at least, won't it, father?"</p>

<p>"Very well; then all you have to do is to bring the
required sum to the prison, and then, and not till then,
your father&mdash;if he is your father&mdash;will be set at liberty.
Come, master, we must start, or we never shall
get there."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to take him away?"</p>

<p>"Do I? Don't I? Just look here; I am ready to give
you a memorandum of having received so much on account;
and, whenever you bring the rest, you shall
have a receipt in full, and your father along with it.
There, now, that's a handsome offer, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Mercy! mercy!" supplicated Louise.</p>

<p>"Whew!" cried the man, "here's a scene over
again! My stars, I hope this one isn't a-going mad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
too, for the whole family seems uncommon queer about
the head! Well, I declare I never see anything like it!
It is enough to set a man 'prespiring' in the midst of winter!"
and here the bailiff burst into a loud, coarse laugh
at his own brutal wit.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor, dear father!" exclaimed Louise, almost
distractedly; "when I had hoped to have saved you!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried the lapidary, in a tone of utter
despair, and stamping his foot in wild desperation,
"hope nothing for me; God has forgotten me, and
Heaven has ceased to be just to a wretch like me!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my worthy friend," said a rich,
manly voice; "there is always a kind Providence that
watches over and preserves good and honest men like
you."</p>

<p>At the same instant Rodolph appeared at the door of
the small recess we have spoken of, from whence he had
been an invisible spectator of much that we have related;
he was pale, and extremely agitated. At this
sudden apparition the bailiff drew back, with surprise;
while Morel and his daughter gazed on the stranger
with bewildered wonder. Taking from his waistcoat
pocket a quantity of folded bank-notes, Rodolph selected
three, and, presenting them to Malicorne, he said:</p>

<p>"Here are two thousand five hundred francs; give
this young woman back the money you have just received
from her."</p>

<p>Still more and more astonished at this singular interference,
the man half hesitated to take the notes, and,
when he had received them, he eyed them with the
utmost suspicion, turning and twisting them about in
every direction; at length, satisfied both as to their
reality and genuineness, he finally deposited them in his
pocketbook: but, as his surprise and alarm began to
subside, so did his natural coarseness of idea return,
and, eyeing Rodolph from head to foot with an impertinent
stare, he exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"The notes are right enough; but pray who and what
are you that go about with such sums? I should just
wish to know whose it is, and how you came by it?"</p>

<p>Rodolph was very plainly dressed, and his appearance
by no means improved by the dust and dirt his clothes
had gathered during his stay in M. Pipelet's Cabinet of
Melodrama.</p>

<p>"I desired you to give back the gold you received just
now from this young person," replied Rodolph, in a
severe and authoritative tone.</p>

<p>"You desired me! And who the devil are you, to give
your orders?" answered the man, approaching Rodolph
in a threatening manner.</p>

<p>"Give back the gold! Give it back, I say!" said
the prince, grasping the wrist of Malicorne so tightly
that the unhappy bailiff winced beneath his iron clutch.</p>

<p>"I say," bawled he, "hands off, will you? Curse
me if I don't think you're old Nick himself! I am sure
your fingers are cased with iron."</p>

<p>"Then return the money! Why, you despicable
wretch! do you want to be paid twice over? Now
return the gold and begone, or, if you utter one insolent
word, I'll fling you over the banisters!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't kick up such a row! There's the girl's
money," said Malicorne, giving back to Louise the
rouleau he had received. "But mind what you are
about, my sparky, and don't think to ill-use me because
you happen to be the strongest!"</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Bourdin, ensconcing himself behind
his taller associate. "And who are you, I should
like to know, who give yourself such airs?"</p>

<p>"Who is he? Why, my lodger, my king of lodgers, you
ill-looking, half-starved, hungry hounds! you ill-taught,
dirty fellows!" exclaimed Madame Pipelet, who, puffing
and panting for breath, had at last reached the landing
where they stood; her head, as usual, adorned with her
Brutus wig, which, during the heat and bustle she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
experienced in ascending the stairs, had got pushed
somewhat awry, while in her hand she bore an earthen
stewpan, filled with smoking-hot broth, which she was
charitably conveying to the Morels.</p>

<p>"What the devil does this old hedgehog want?" cried
Bourdin.</p>

<p>"If you dare make any of your saucy speeches about
me," returned Madame Pipelet, "I'll make you feel my
nails,&mdash;ay, and my teeth, too, if you provoke me! And,
if you don't mend your manners, my lodger, my king of
lodgers will pitch you over the banisters, and I will
sweep you out into the street, as I would a heap of
rubbish."</p>

<p>"This old beldam will bring the whole house about
our ears," said Bourdin to Malicorne; "we've touched
the blunt, our expenses and all, so I say 'Off' is a good
word."</p>

<p>"Here, take your property," said the latter, flinging a
bundle of law-papers at the feet of Morel.</p>

<p>"Pick them up, and deliver them decently; you have
been paid as a respectable officer would have been, act
like one!" cried Rodolph, seizing the bailiff vigorously
with one hand, while with the other he pointed to the
papers.</p>

<p>Fully convinced by this second powerful grip how useless
any attempt at resistance would prove, the bailiff
stooped down, and, mechanically picking up the papers,
gave them to Morel, who, scarcely venturing to credit his
senses, believed himself under the influence of a delightful
dream.</p>

<p>"Well, young chap," grumbled out Malicorne, "although
you have got a fist as strong as a drayman's,
mind you, if ever you fall into my clutches, I'll make
you smart for this!" So saying, he doubled his fist at
Rodolph, and then scrambled down the stairs, taking
four or five at a time, followed by his companion, who
kept looking behind him with indescribable terror;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
while Madame Pipelet, burning to avenge the insults
offered to her king of lodgers, looked at her steaming
stewpan with an air of inspiration, and heroically exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The debts of the Morels are paid! Henceforward
they will have plenty of food, and can do without my
messes! Look out there below!"</p>

<p>So saying, she stooped over the banisters, and poured
the contents of her stewpan down the backs and shoulders
of the two bailiffs, who had just reached the first
floor landing.</p>

<p>"There goes!" screamed out the delighted porteress.
"Capital! Ha, ha, ha! there they are! two regular sops,
in the pan! Well, I do enjoy this!"</p>

<p>"What the devil is this?" exclaimed Malicorne,
thoroughly soaked with the hot, greasy liquid. "I
say, I wish you would mind what you are about up
there, you old figure of fun!"</p>

<p>"Alfred!" bawled Madame Pipelet, in a tone sharp
and shrill enough to have split the tympanum of a deaf
man; "Alfred, my old darling, have at 'em! They
wanted to behave ill to your 'Stasie (Anastasie)! The
nasty fellows have been taking liberties,&mdash;quite violent!
Knock them down with your broom! And call the
oyster-woman, and the man at the wine-vaults, to help
you! Get out, you! Get&mdash;get&mdash;get out! Cht, cht,
cht! Thieves! thieves! robbers! Cht&mdash;b-r-r-r-r-r-r&mdash;hou,
hou, hou! Knock them&mdash;knock them down!
That's right, old dear! Pay them off! Break their
bones! Serve them out! Boum, boum, boum!"</p>

<p>And, by way of conclusion to this concatenation of
discordant noises, accompanied by a constant succession
of stamping and kicking of feet, Madame Pipelet, carried
away by the excitement of the moment, flung her earthen
stewpan to the bottom of the staircase, which, breaking
into a thousand pieces at the very instant that the two
bailiffs, terrified by the yells and noises from overhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
were precipitately descending the stairs with hasty strides,
added not a little to their terror.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, ah!" cried Anastasie, bursting into loud
fits of laughter. "Now be off with you,&mdash;I think you
have had enough!" Then, crossing her arms, she stood,
like a triumphant Amazon, rejoicing in the victory she
had achieved.</p>

<p>While Madame Pipelet was thus venting her rage
upon the bailiffs, Morel had thrown himself, in heartfelt
gratitude, at the feet of Rodolph.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," exclaimed he, when at last words came to
his assistance, "you have saved a whole family! To
whom do we owe this unhoped-for assistance?"</p>

<p>"'To the God who watches over and protects all
honest men,' as your immortal Béranger says."</p>

<div class="blockquot note">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The following are some curious particulars relative
to bodily restraint, as cited in the "Pauvre Jacques," a journal
published under the patronage of the "Society for the Furtherance
and Protection of Christianity:"</p>

<p>
(Prison Committee.) (<i>Comité des Prisons.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>"A protest and intimation of bodily restraint are generally
carried about by sheriffs' officers, and charged by law, the first,
4<i>f.</i> 35<i>c.</i>, the second, 4<i>f.</i> 70<i>c.</i>; for these, however, the officers
usually demand, for the former, 10<i>f.</i> 40<i>c.</i>, for the second, 16<i>f.</i>
40<i>c.</i>; thus illegally claiming from the unfortunate victims of
law 26<i>f.</i> 80<i>c.</i>, for that which is fixed by that very law at 9<i>f.</i> 50<i>c.</i></p>

<p>"For an arrest, the legal charge is, including stamp and registering,
3<i>f.</i> 50<i>c.</i>; coach-hire, 5<i>f.</i>; for arrest and entry in the prison
books, 60<i>f.</i> 25<i>c.</i>; office dues, 8<i>f.</i> Total, 76<i>f.</i> 75<i>c.</i> A bill of the
usual scale ordinarily charged by sheriffs' officers, now lying
before us, shows that these allowances by law are magnified by
the extortion of the officers into a sum of about 240<i>f.</i>, instead of
the 76<i>f.</i> they are alone entitled to claim."</p>

<p>The same journal says: "Sheriffs' officer &mdash;&mdash; has been to our
office, requesting us to correct an article which appeared in one
of our numbers, headed, 'A woman hung.' 'I did not hang the
woman!' observed he, angrily. We did not assert that he did,
but, to prevent any further misapprehension, content ourselves with
reprinting the paragraph in question: 'A few days ago, a sheriffs'
officer, named &mdash;&mdash;, went to the Rue de la Lune, to arrest a carpenter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
who dwelt there. The man, perceiving him from the
street, rushed hastily into his house, exclaiming, "I am a ruined
man! The officers are here to arrest me!" His wife, at these
words, hastened to secure the door; while the carpenter ran to
a room on the top of the house, to conceal himself. The officer,
finding admittance refused, went and fetched a magistrate and a
blacksmith; the door was forced, and, on proceeding up-stairs,
the woman was found hanging in her own bedchamber. The
officer did not allow himself to be diverted from the pursuit by
the sight of the corpse; he continued his search, and at length
discovered the husband in his hiding-place. "I arrest you!"
cried the bailiff. "I have no money!" replied the man. "Then
you must go to prison." "Let me at least bid my wife adieu!"
"It is not worth while waiting for that,&mdash;your wife is dead! She
has hung herself!"' Now, M. &mdash;&mdash; (adds the journal we have
quoted), what have you to say to that? You see we have merely
copied your own statement upon oath, in which you have detailed
all these frightful circumstances with horrible minuteness!"</p>

<p>The same journal also cites two or three hundred similar facts,
of which the following may serve as a specimen: "The expenses
upon a note of hand for 300<i>f.</i> have been run up by the sheriffs'
officers to 964<i>f.</i>; the debtor, therefore, who is a mere artisan,
with a family of five children, has been detained in prison for
the last seven months!"</p>

<p>The author of this work had a double reason for borrowing
thus largely from the pages of the "Pauvre Jacques." In the
first place, to show that the horrors of the last chapter are far
below reality in their painful details. And secondly, to prove
that, if only viewed in a philanthropic light, the allowing such
a state of things to go on (namely, the exorbitant and illegal
fees both demanded and exacted by certain public functionaries),
frequently acts as a preventive to the exercise of benevolence,
and paralyses the hand of charity. Thus, were a small capital
of 1000<i>f.</i> collected among kind-hearted individuals, three or four
honest, though unfortunate, artisans might be released from
a prison and restored to their families, by employing the above-named
sum in paying the debts of such as were incarcerated for
amounts varying from 250 to 300<i>f.!</i> But when the original
debt is increased threefold by the excessive and illegal expenses,
even the most charitable recede from the good work of delivering
a fellow creature, from the impression that two-thirds of their
well-intentioned bounty would only go into the pockets of pampered
sheriffs' officers and their satellites. And yet no class of
unfortunate beings stand more in need of aid and charitable assistance
than the unfortunate class we have just been speaking of.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h5>RIGOLETTE.</h5>


<p>Louise, the daughter of the lapidary, was possessed of
more than ordinary loveliness of countenance, a fine,
tall, graceful person, uniting, by the strict regularity of
her faultless features and elegance of her figure, the
classic beauty of Juno with the lightness and elegance
assigned to the statue of the hunting Diana. Spite of
the injury her complexion had received from exposure
to weather, and the redness of her well-shaped hands
and arms, occasioned by household labour,&mdash;despite
even the humble dress she wore, the whole appearance
of Louise Morel was stamped with that indescribable
air of grace and superiority Nature sometimes is pleased
to bestow upon the lowly-born, in preference to the
descendant of high lineage.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to paint the joy, the heartfelt
gratitude of this family, so wondrously preserved from
so severe a calamity; even the recent death of the little
girl was forgotten during the first burst of happiness.
Rodolph alone found leisure to remark the extreme paleness
and utter abstraction of Louise, whose first ecstasy
at finding her father free passed away, apparently plunged
in a deep and painful reverie. Anxious to relieve the
mind of Morel of any apprehensions for the future, and
also to explain a liberality which might have raised suspicions
as to the character he chose to assume, Rodolph
drew the lapidary to the further end of the staircase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
leaving to Rigolette the task of acquainting Louise with
the death of her little sister, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Did not a young lady come to visit you and your
family on the morning of the day before yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and appeared much grieved to see the distress
we were in."</p>

<p>"Then you must thank her,&mdash;not me."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible, sir? That young lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is your benefactress. I frequently wait upon her
from our warehouse; when I hired an apartment here, I
learned from the porteress all the particulars of your
case, and the painful situation you were placed in;
relying on this lady's well-known kindness and benevolence,
I hastened to acquaint her with all I had heard
respecting you; and, the day before yesterday, she came
herself, in order to be fully aware of the extent of your
misery. The distress she witnessed deeply affected her;
but as it might have been brought about by misconduct,
she desired me to take upon myself the task of inquiring
into every circumstance relative to your past and present
condition with as little delay as possible, being desirous
of regulating her benevolent aid by the good or bad
accounts she might receive of your honesty and good
conduct."</p>

<p>"Kind, excellent lady! Well might I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As you observed just now to Madeleine, 'If the rich
did but know!'&mdash;was not that it?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you are acquainted with the name
of my wife? Who could have told you that?"</p>

<p>"My worthy friend," said Rodolph, interrupting
Morel, "I have been concealed in the little garret
adjoining your attic since six o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my honest fellow, I have, and from my
hiding-place heard all that passed among you."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! but why did you do so?"</p>

<p>"I could not have employed more satisfactory means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
of getting at your real character and sentiments; and I
was desirous of seeing and hearing all you did or said
without your being aware of my presence. The porter
had made me acquainted with this small retreat, which
he offered to me for a wood-closet. This morning, I
asked his permission to visit it, and remained there
more than an hour, during which time I had ample
proof that a more upright, noble mind did not exist, and
that the courageous resignation with which you bore
your heavy trials was above all praise."</p>

<p>"Nay, indeed, sir, I do not merit such words as these.
I was born honest, I hope, and it comes natural to me
to act as I have done."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure of that; therefore I do not laud
your conduct, I appreciate it. Just as I was about to
quit my hiding-place, to relieve you of the presence of
the bailiffs, I heard the voice of your daughter, and I
meant to have allowed her the happiness of saving you.
Unhappily, the rapacity of the men deprived poor Louise
of the full completion of her pious task. I then made
my appearance. Fortunately, I yesterday received several
sums that were due to me, so that I was enabled to
advance the money for your benefactress, and to pay off
your unfortunate debt. But your distress has been so
great, so unmerited, and so nobly sustained, that the
well-deserved interest you have excited shall not stop
here; and I take upon myself, in the name of your
preserving angel, to promise you henceforward calmness,
peace, and happiness, for yourself and family."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible? But, at least, sir, let me
beseech you to tell me the name of this angel of
goodness,&mdash;this heavenly preserver,&mdash;that it may dwell
in our hearts and on our lips! By what name shall we
bless her in our prayers?"</p>

<p>"Think of her and speak of her as the angel she is.
Ah, you were right in saying just now that both rich
and poor had their sorrows!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"And is this dear lady, then, unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Who is free from care and suffering in this world of
trial? But I see no cause for concealing from you the
name of your protectress. The lady, then, is named&mdash;"</p>

<p>Remembering that Madame Pipelet was aware of
Madame d'Harville's having, at her first coming to
the house, inquired for the commandant, and fearing
her indiscreet mention of the circumstance, Rodolph
resumed, after a short pause:</p>

<p>"I will venture to tell you this lady's name, upon one
condition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray go on, sir."</p>

<p>"That you never mention it again to any one,&mdash;mind,
I say to any person whatever."</p>

<p>"I solemnly promise you never to let it pass my lips;
but may I not hope to be permitted to thank this friend
of the unfortunate?"</p>

<p>"I will let Madame d'Harville know your wish; but
I scarcely think she will consent to it."</p>

<p>"Then this generous lady is called&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Marquise d'Harville."</p>

<p>"Never will that name be forgotten by me! Henceforward
it will be to me as that of my patron saint,&mdash;the
object of my grateful worship! Oh, when I remember
that, thanks to her, my wife, children,&mdash;all, are
saved!&mdash;saved&mdash;no, no, not all,&mdash;my little Adèle has
gone from us! We shall see her sweet face no more;
but still, I know we must have parted with her sooner
or later; the dear child's doom was long since decreed!"</p>

<p>Here the poor lapidary wiped away the tears which
filled his eyes at the recollection of his lost darling.</p>

<p>"As for the last duties that have now to be performed
for your poor child," said Rodolph, "if you
will be guided by me, this is how we will arrange it.
I have not yet begun to occupy my chamber; it is
large, airy, and convenient. There is already one bed
in it; and I will give orders to add all that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
requisite for the accommodation of yourself and family,
until Madame d'Harville is enabled to find an eligible
abode for you. The remains of your little daughter can
then be left in your attic, where, until the period of
interment, they can be properly watched and guarded
by a priest with all requisite attention. I will request
M. Pipelet to take upon himself every necessary arrangement
for the mournful office of laying the poor babe in
its peaceful grave."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir,&mdash;but, indeed, I cannot allow you to be
turned out of your apartment! Now that we are so
happily freed from our misery, and that I have no longer
the dread of being dragged to prison, our poor garret
will seem to me like a palace,&mdash;more especially if my
Louise remains to watch over the family as she used
to do."</p>

<p>"Your daughter shall never again quit you. You
said, awhile ago, that the first desire of your heart
was to have Louise always with you. Well then, as
a reward for your past sufferings, I promise you she
shall never leave you more."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, this is too much; it cannot be reality! It
seems as though I were dreaming some happy dream.
I fear I have never been as religious as I ought. I have,
in fact, known no other religion than that of honour.
But such a reverse, such a change from wretchedness to
joy, would make even an atheist believe, if not in priests,
at least in a gracious, interposing, and preserving Providence."</p>

<p>"And if," said Rodolph, sadly, "a father's sorrow for
the loss of his child can be assuaged by promises of
rewards or recompense, I would say that the heavenly
hand which takes one child from you gives you back the
other."</p>

<p>"True,&mdash;most true! And henceforward our dear
Louise will be with us to help us to forget our poor
Adèle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you will accept the offer of my chamber, will
you not? Or else how shall we be able to arrange for
the mournful duties to the poor infant? Think of your
wife, whose head is already in so weak a state. It will
never do to allow her to remain with so afflicting a spectacle
constantly before her eyes."</p>

<p>"What goodness," exclaimed the lapidary, "thus to
remember all,&mdash;to think of all! Oh, you are indeed a
friend! May Heaven bless and recompense you!"</p>

<p>"Come, you must reserve your thanks for the excellent
lady you term your protecting angel. 'Tis her
goodness inspires me with a desire to imitate her benevolence
and charity. I feel assured I am but speaking
as she would speak, were she here, and that all I do she
will fully approve. So now, then, it is arranged you will
occupy my room. But, just tell me, this Jacques
Ferrand&mdash;"</p>

<p>The forehead of Morel became clouded over at the
mention of this name.</p>

<p>"I suppose," continued Rodolph, "there is no doubt
as to his being the same Jacques Ferrand who practises
as a notary in the Rue du Sentier?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, sir," answered Morel; "but do you
know him?" Then, assailed afresh by his fears for
Louise, the lapidary continued: "Since you overheard
all our conversation, tell me, sir,&mdash;tell me, do you not
think I have just cause to hate this man, as I do? For
who knows but my daughter&mdash;my Louise&mdash;"</p>

<p>The unhappy artisan could not proceed; he groaned
with anguish, and concealed his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Rodolph easily divined the nature of his apprehensions.</p>

<p>"The very step taken by the notary ought to reassure
your mind," said he, "as, there can be no doubt, he was
instigated by revenge for your daughter's rejection of
his improper advances to proceed to the hostile measures
adopted. However, I have every reason to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
he is a very bad and dangerous man; and if my suspicions
respecting him are realised," said Rodolph, after
a few moments' silence, "then rely on Providence to
punish him. If the just vengeance of the Almighty
seems occasionally to slumber, it awakens, sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"He is both rich and hypocritical!" cried the lapidary.</p>

<p>"At the moment of your deepest despair, a guardian
angel appeared to save you from ruin; so, at the moment
when least expected, will an inexorable Avenger
call upon the notary to atone for his past crimes, if he
be guilty."</p>

<p>At this moment Rigolette came out of the miserable
garret belonging to Morel; the kind-hearted girl had
evidently been shedding tears, and was trying to dry her
eyes before she descended the stairs. Directly Rodolph
perceived her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Tell me, my good neighbour, will it not be much better
for M. Morel and his family to occupy my chamber
while they are waiting till his benefactress, whose agent
I am, shall have found a comfortable residence for
him?"</p>

<p>Rigolette surveyed Rodolph with an air of unfeigned
surprise.</p>

<p>"Really," cried she, at length, "are you in earnest in
making so kind and considerate an offer?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, on one condition, which depends on yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, all that is in my power!"</p>

<p>"You see, I had some rather difficult accounts to arrange
for my employer, which are wanted as early as
possible,&mdash;indeed, I expect they will be sent for almost
directly; my papers are in my room. Now would you
be neighbourly enough to let me bring my work into
your apartment, and just spare a little corner of your
table? I should not disturb your work the least in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
world, and then the whole of the Morel family, by the
assistance of Madame Pipelet and her husband, may be
at once established in my apartment."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will, and with great pleasure; neighbours
should always be ready to help and oblige each
other. I am sure, after all you have done for poor
M. Morel, you have set a good example; so I shall be
very glad to give you all the assistance in my power,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"No, no,&mdash;don't call me monsieur! say 'my dear
friend,' or 'neighbour,' whichever you prefer; unless you
lay aside all ceremony, I shall not have courage to intrude
myself and papers into your room," said Rodolph,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, pray don't let that be any hindrance; then, if
you like, I'll call you 'neighbour,' because, you know,
you are so."</p>

<p>"Father! father!" said one of Morel's little boys,
coming out of the garret, "mother is calling for you!
Make haste, father,&mdash;pray do!"</p>

<p>The lapidary hastily followed the child back to his
chamber.</p>

<p>"Now, then, neighbour," said Rodolph to Rigolette,
"you must do me one more service."</p>

<p>"With all my heart, if it lies in my power to do
so."</p>

<p>"I feel quite sure you are a clever manager and housekeeper;
now we must go to work at once to provide the
Morels with comfortable clothing, and such matters as
may be essential for their accommodation in my apartment,
which at present merely contains my slender stock
of bachelor's furniture, sent in yesterday. Beds, bedding,
and a great quantity of requisites will be needed for so
many persons; and I want you to assist me in procuring
them all the comforts I wish them to have with as little
delay as possible."</p>

<p>Rigolette reflected a moment, and then replied:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall have all this before two hours have passed:
good clothes, nicely made, warm and comfortable, good
white linen for all the family, two small beds for the
children, one for the grandmother, and, in fact, all that
is required; but, I can tell you, all this will cost a great,
great deal of money."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i> and how much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at least&mdash;the very least, five or six hundred
francs."</p>

<p>"For everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you see it is a great sum of money," said
Rigolette, opening her eyes very wide and shaking her
head.</p>

<p>"But we could procure all this?"</p>

<p>"Within two hours."</p>

<p>"My little neighbour, you must be a fairy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! it is easy enough. The Temple is but two
steps from here, and you will get there everything you
require."</p>

<p>"The Temple?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Temple."</p>

<p>"What place is that?"</p>

<p>"What, neighbour, don't you know the Temple?"</p>

<p>"No, neighbour."</p>

<p>"Yet it is the place where such persons as you and
I fit themselves out in furniture and clothes, when they
are economical. It is much cheaper than any other
place, and the things are also good."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"I think so. Well, now, I suppose&mdash;how much did
you pay for your greatcoat?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say precisely."</p>

<p>"What, neighbour! not know how much you gave for
your greatcoat?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, in confidence, neighbour," said Rodolph,
smiling, "that I owe for it; so, you see, I cannot
exactly say."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, neighbour, neighbour, you do not appear to me
to be very orderly in your habits!"</p>

<p>"Alas, neighbour, I fear not!"</p>

<p>"I must cure you of that, if you desire that we should
continue friends; and I see already that we shall be, for
you seem so kind! You will not be sorry to have me
for a neighbour, I can see. You will assist me and I
shall assist you,&mdash;we are neighbours, and that's why.
I shall look after your linen; you will give me your help
in cleaning my room. I am up very early in the morning,
and will call you, that you may not be late in going
to your work; I will knock against the wainscot until
you say to me, 'Good morning, neighbour!'"</p>

<p>"That's agreed; you shall awaken me, you shall take
charge of my linen, and I will clean out your room."</p>

<p>"Certainly. And, when you have anything to buy,
you must go to the Temple; for see now, for example,
your greatcoat must have cost you eighty francs, I have
no doubt; well, you might have bought one just as good
at the Temple for thirty francs."</p>

<p>"Really, that is marvellous! And so you think that
for four or five hundred francs these poor Morels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will be completely set up, and very comfortable for
a long while."</p>

<p>"Neighbour, an idea comes across me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is this idea?"</p>

<p>"Do you understand all about household affairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I should think so," said Rigolette, with a slight
affectation of manner.</p>

<p>"Take my arm, then, and let us go to the Temple and
buy all these things for the Morels; won't that be a good
way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how capital! Poor souls! But, then, the
money?"</p>

<p>"I have it."</p>

<p>"What, five hundred francs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>"The benefactor of the Morels has given me <i>carte
blanche</i>; and she will spare nothing to see these poor
people restored to comfort. Is there any place where
we can buy better supplies than at the Temple?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; you will not find better things anywhere;
and then there is everything, and all ready,
there; little frocks for children, and gowns for the
mother."</p>

<p>"Well, then, neighbour, let us go at once to the
Temple:"</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon Dieu!</i> but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; only, you see, my time is everything to
me, and I am already a little behindhand, through coming
here to watch over poor Madame Morel; and you
must know that an hour in one way, and an hour in
another, that by little and little makes whole days; well,
a day is thirty sous, and, whether we gain something or
nothing, we must live; but bah! never mind. I will
make up for that at night, and then, d'ye see, parties of
pleasure are very rare, and I call this one. It will seem
to me that I am rich, rich, rich, and that it is with my
own money that I shall buy all these things for the
Morels. So come along, neighbour, I will throw on my
shawl and cap, and then I am ready."</p>

<p>"Suppose, whilst you are doing this, I bring my papers
to your apartment?"</p>

<p>"Willingly; and then you will see my room," said
Rigolette, with pride, "for it is all tidy, which will convince
you how early I am in the morning; and that, if
you are idle and a sluggard, so much the worse for you,
for I shall be a troublesome neighbour."</p>

<p>So saying, light as a bird, Rigolette descended the
staircase, followed by Rodolph, who went into his own
room to brush off the dust which had settled on him in
M. Pipelet's garret. We will hereafter disclose how it
was that Rodolph was not informed of the carrying off
of Fleur-de-Marie from the farm at Bouqueval, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
why he had not visited the Morels the day after his
conversation with Madame d'Harville.</p>

<p>Rodolph, furnished, by way of saving appearances,
with a thick roll of papers, entered Rigolette's chamber.</p>

<p>Rigolette was nearly the same age as Goualeuse, her
old prison acquaintance. There was between these two
young girls the same difference that there is between
laughter and tears; between joyous light-heartedness and
melancholy dejection; between the wildest thoughtlessness
and a dark and constant reflection on the future;
between a delicate, refined, elevated, poetic nature, exquisitely
sensitive, and incurably wounded by remorse, and
a gay, lively, happy, good, and compassionate nature.
Rigolette had no sorrows but those derived from the
woes of others, and with these she sympathised with all
her might, devoting herself, body and soul, to any suffering
fellow creature; but, her back turned on them, to
use a common expression, she thought no more about
them. She often checked her bursts of laughter by a
flood of tears, and then checked her tears by renewing
her laughter. Like a real Parisian, Rigolette preferred
excitement to calm, and motion to repose; the loud and
echoing harmony of the orchestra at the fête of the
Chartreuse or the Colysée to the soft murmurs of the
breeze, waters, and leaves; the bustling disturbance of
the thoroughfares of Paris to the silent solitude of the
fields; the brilliancy of fireworks, the flaring of the grand
finale, the uproar of the maroons and Roman candles, to
the serenity of a lovely night,&mdash;starlight, clear, and still.
Alas, yes! the dear, good little girl actually preferred the
pavement of the streets of the capital to the fresh
moss of the shaded paths, perfumed with violets; the
dust of the Boulevards to the waving of the ears of corn,
mingled with the scarlet of the wild poppies and the azure
of the bluebells.</p>

<p>Rigolette only left her chamber on Sundays, and each
morning to provide her prescribed allowance of chickweed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
bread, milk, and millet, for herself and her two
birds, as Madame Pipelet observed; but she lived in
Paris for Paris, and would have been wretched to have
resided anywhere but in the capital.</p>

<p>A few words as to the personal appearance of the
grisette, and we will then introduce Rodolph into the
chamber of his neighbour.</p>

<p>Rigolette was scarcely eighteen years of age, of middle
height, rather small than large, but so gracefully formed,
so admirably proportioned, so delightfully filled out, so
entirely in accordance with her step, which was light
and easy, that she seemed perfect of her kind. The
movement of her finely formed feet, always encased in
well-made boots of black cloth, with a rather thick sole,
reminded you of the quick, pretty, and cautious tread of
the quail or wagtail. She did not seem to walk, but to
pass over the pavement as if she were gliding over the
surface. This step, so peculiar to grisettes, at once
nimble, attractive, and as if somewhat alarmed, may
doubtless be attributed to three causes: their desire to
be thought pretty, their fear of being mistaken for what
they are not, and to the desire they always have not to
lose a minute in their peregrinations.</p>

<p>Rodolph had not seen Rigolette but by the dim light
of Morel's garret, or on the landing-place, equally obscure,
and he was therefore really struck by the bright
and fresh countenance of the young girl when he softly
entered her apartment, which was lighted up by two
large windows. He remained motionless for a moment,
in admiration of the striking picture before his eyes.
Standing in front of a glass placed over her mantelpiece,
Rigolette was tying under her chin the ribands of a small
cap of bordered tulle, ornamented with a light trimming
of cherry-coloured riband. The cap, which fitted tightly,
was placed at the back of her head, and thus revealed
two large and thick bandeaux of glossy hair, shining like
jet, and falling very low in front. Her eyebrows, fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and well defined, seemed as if traced in ink, and curved
above two large black, piercing, and intelligent eyes; her
firm and velvety cheeks were suffused with the rosy hue
of health, fresh to the eye, fresh to the touch, like a ripe
peach covered with the dew of dawn; her small, upturned,
attractive, and saucy nose, would have been a
fortune to any Lisette or Marton; her mouth, which was
rather large, had rosy and moist lips, small, white, close,
and pearly teeth, and was laughter-loving and sportive;
three charming dimples, which gave a characteristic grace
to her features, were placed, two in her cheeks, and the
other in her chin, close to a beauty-spot, a small ebony
speck, which was most killingly situated at the corner of
her mouth. Between a worked collar, which fell very
low, and the border of the little cap, gathered in by a
cherry-coloured riband, was seen a forest of beautiful
hair, so accurately twisted and turned up that their
roots were seen as clearly and as black as if they had
been painted on the ivory of that lovely neck. A plum-coloured
merino gown, with a plain back and close sleeves,
made skilfully by Rigolette, covered a figure so small
and slender that the young girl never wore a corset,&mdash;for
economy's sake. An ease and unusual freedom in
the smallest action of the shoulders and body, which resembled
the facile undulations of a cat's motions, evinced
this fact. Imagine a gown fitting tightly to a form
rounded and polished as marble, and we must agree that
Rigolette could easily dispense with this accessory to the
toilet of which we have spoken. The tie of a small
apron of dark green levantine formed a girdle around a
waist which might have been spanned by the ten fingers.</p>

<p>Believing herself to be alone (for Rodolph still remained
at the door, motionless and unperceived), the
grisette, having smoothed down her bandeaux with her
small hand, white and delicately clean, put her small
foot on a chair and stooped to tie the lace of her boot.
This attitude developed to Rodolph a portion of a cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
stocking, white as snow, and a well-formed ankle and
leg.</p>

<p>After the detail we have given of this toilet, we may
guess that Rigolette had selected her prettiest cap and
best apron to do honour to her neighbour on their excursion
to the Temple. She found the pretended tradesman's
clerk very much to her taste; his face, at once
kind, bold, and animated, pleased her greatly; and then
he had been so kind to the Morels, by giving up his room
to them; so that, thanks to this proof of goodness, and,
perhaps, also to his good looks, Rodolph had unwittingly
advanced into the confidence of the grisette with giant
strides. She, according to her ideas, founded on the
compelled intimacy and reciprocal obligation which
neighbourhood invites, thought herself very fortunate in
having such a neighbour as Rodolph to succeed to the
travelling clerk, Cabrion, and François Germain; for she
was beginning to find that the next room had remained
very long empty, and was afraid that she should never
again see it occupied in an agreeable manner.</p>

<p>Rodolph took advantage of his invisibility to cast a
curious eye around him, and he found the apartment
even beyond the praises which Madame Pipelet had bestowed
on the extreme cleanliness of the humble home
of Rigolette. Nothing could be more lively or better
arranged than this apartment. A gray paper, with green
garlands, covered the walls; the floor, painted of a red
colour, shone like a looking-glass; a small earthenware
stone was placed in the chimney, where was piled up,
very symmetrically, a small store of wood, cut so short,
so thin, that, without exaggeration, each piece might
have been compared to a very large match. On the
stone mantelpiece, painted gray marble, there were, for
ornaments, two pots of common flowers, covered in with
green moss; a small case of boxwood contained a silver
watch instead of a pendule. On one side was a brass
candlestick, shining like gold, and having in it a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
piece of wax-light; and, on the other side, no less resplendently,
one of those lamps formed by a cylinder and
a brass reflector, supported by a bar of steel, and having
a base of lead. A tolerably large square glass, in a
black wood frame, was over the mantelpiece. Curtains
of gray and green Persian cloth, with a woollen-fringed
border, cut and worked by Rigolette, and hung in light
rings of black iron, decorated the windows; and the bed
was covered with a counterpane of the same make and
material. Two closets, with glass doors, and painted
white, were in each side of the recess, enclosing, no
doubt, household utensils,&mdash;the portable stove, the fountain,
brooms, etc.; for none of these things spoiled the
neat appearance of the chamber. A chest of drawers of
well veined and shining walnut-tree; four chairs of the
same wood; a large table for ironing and working, covered
with one of those green woollen coverings which we
sometimes see in a peasant's cottage; a straw armchair,
with a stool to match, the constant seat of the workwoman,&mdash;such
was the unpretending furniture. There
was, too, in one of the window-seats, a cage with two
canary birds, the faithful companions of Rigolette. By
one of those notable ideas which occur to the poor, this
cage was placed in the middle of a large wooden chest,
about a foot deep, placed on a table. This chest, which
Rigolette called her bird's garden, was filled with mould,
covered with moss during the winter, and in spring the
young girl sowed grass seeds, and planted flowers there.
Rodolph examined the place with interest, and entered
fully into the cheerful disposition of the grisette. He
pictured to himself this solitude, enlivened by the song
of the birds and of Rigolette herself. In summer, no
doubt, she worked at the open window, half veiled by a
verdant curtain of sweet peas, roses, nasturtiums, and
blue and white convolvulus. In winter she warmed
herself near her small stove, by the soft light of her
lamp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodolph was thus reflecting, when, looking mechanically
at the door, he saw there a large bolt,&mdash;a bolt
which would not have been out of place on the door of a
prison. This bolt made him reflect. It might have two
meanings, two very distinct uses: to close the door on
the lover within; to close the door on the lover without.
Rodolph was aroused from his reflections by Rigolette,
who, turning her head, saw him, and, without changing
her attitude, said to him:</p>

<p>"What, neighbour, are you there?" Then the well-formed
ankle instantly disappeared beneath the ample
skirt of the plum-coloured gown, and Rigolette added,
"Ah, Mr. Cunning!"</p>

<p>"I was here admiring in silence."</p>

<p>"Admiring what, neighbour?"</p>

<p>"This pretty little room; for, neighbour, you are
lodged like a queen."</p>

<p>"Why, you must know that is my enjoyment. I never
go out, and so I can do no less than make my home comfortable."</p>

<p>"But really I never saw anything half so nice. What
pretty curtains! and the drawers as handsome as mahogany!
You must have spent a great deal of money here."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mention it! I had, of my own, four hundred
and twenty-five francs when I left the prison, and
almost all has been spent."</p>

<p>"When you left the prison!&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is a very long story. Of course, you do
not suppose that I was in prison for anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Of course not; but how was it?"</p>

<p>"After the cholera, I was quite alone in the world.
I was then, I think, ten years of age."</p>

<p>"But who had taken care of you till then?"</p>

<p>"Ah, some excellent people! But they died of the
cholera;" here Rigolette's large eyes became moistened.
"They had sold the little they possessed to pay their small
debts, and I remained without having any one who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
take care of me. Not knowing what to do, I went to the
guard-house, opposite to our house, and said to the sentinel:
'Sir, my relations are dead, and I do not know
where to go to; what must I do?' Then the officer
came, and he took me to the commissary, who put me in
prison as a vagabond, and I did not go out until I was
sixteen years old."</p>

<p>"But your relations?"</p>

<p>"I do not know who my father was, and I was six
years old when I lost my mother, who had recovered me
from the Enfants Trouvés (Foundling Hospital), where
she had been compelled at first to place me. The kind
people of whom I spoke to you lived in our house; they
had no children, and, seeing me an orphan, they took
care of me."</p>

<p>"And what were they? What was their business or
pursuit?"</p>

<p>"Papa Crétu, so I always called him, was a house-painter,
and his wife worked at her needle."</p>

<p>"Then they were pretty well off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, like other people in their station, though they
were not married; but they called each other husband
and wife. They had their ups and downs; to-day plenty,
if there was work to be had; to-morrow short commons,
if there was none; but that did not prevent the couple
from being content and always cheerful;" at this remembrance
Rigolette's face brightened up. "There was not
such a household in the quarter,&mdash;always merry, always
singing, and, with it all, as good as they could be. What
they had any one was welcome to share. Mamma Crétu
was a plump body, about thirty years old, as neat as a
penny, as active as an eel, as merry as a lark. Her husband
was a regular good-tempered fellow, with a large
nose, a wide mouth, and always a paper cap on his head,
and such a funny face,&mdash;oh, so funny,&mdash;you could not
look at him without laughing. When he came home
after work, he did nothing but sing, and make faces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
gambol like a child. He used to dance me on his knees,
and play with me like a child of my own age; and his
wife spoiled me, as if I had been a blessing to her. They
both required only one thing from me, and that was to
be in a good humour; and in that I never thwarted
them, thank Heaven. So they called me Rigolette,<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
the name has stuck to me. As to mirth, they set me the
example, for I never saw them sorrowful. If ever there
was a word, it was the wife who said to her husband,
'Crétu, you silly fellow, do be quiet, you make me laugh
too much.' Then he said to her, 'Hold your foolish
tongue, Ramonette,'&mdash;I don't know why he called her
Ramonette,&mdash;'do be still, you really make my sides ache,
you are so funny.' And then I laughed to see them
laugh, and in this way I was brought up, and in this
way they formed my disposition; and I hope I have
profited by it."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The French verb <i>rigoler</i> is "to be merry."&mdash;E. T.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Most assuredly you have, neighbour. So there never
were any disputes between them?"</p>

<p>"Never, oh, never! Sunday, Monday, and sometimes
on Tuesday, they made holiday, or kept wedding-day, as
they called it, and always took me with them. Papa
Crétu was an excellent workman, and, when he chose to
work, he could earn what he pleased, and so could his
wife, too. If they had got enough to do for Sunday and
Monday, and live on pretty comfortably, they were perfectly
satisfied. If, after this, they were on short allowance
for a time, they didn't mind it. I remember, when
we had only bread and water, Papa Crétu took from his
library&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had a library, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he used to call a little box so, in which he put
his collection of new songs; for he bought all the new
ones, and knew them every one. When, then, there was
nothing but bread in the house, he used to take an old
cookery book from his library, and say to us, 'Well, now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
let us see, what shall we eat to-day? This, or that?'
And then he used to read out a long list of good things.
Each of us chose a dish, and then Papa Crétu took an
empty saucepan, and, with the funniest airs and gestures
in the world, pretended to put into the saucepan all the
ingredients requisite for making a capital stew; and then
he used to pretend to pour it all out into a dish&mdash;also
empty&mdash;which he placed on the table, with still the same
drolleries, which almost split our sides. Then he took
up his book again, and, whilst he was reading to us, for
instance, the recipe of a good fricassée of chicken, which
we had chosen, and which made our mouths water, we
ate our bread, all laughing like so many mad people."</p>

<p>"And, in this happy household, were there any debts
to trouble them?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. So long as the money lasted, they
ate, drank, and made merry, and, when it was all gone,
they lived upon 'make believe,' as before."</p>

<p>"And did they never think of the future?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they thought of it, of course; but what is
the future to such as we? Present and future are like
Sunday and Monday; the one we spend gaily and happily
outside the barriers, the other is got over in the faubourgs."</p>

<p>"And why, since this couple seemed so well assorted,
did they never marry?"</p>

<p>"A friend of theirs once put that very question in my
presence."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did they say?"</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said they, 'if ever we have any children, it may
be all very well to marry, but as far as we are concerned,
we do very well as we are. And why should we make
an obligation of that which we now perform willingly? Besides,
getting married costs money, and we have none to
spare in unnecessary expenses.' But, my goodness,"
added Rigolette, "how I am running on. But, really,
when once I begin to talk of these kind people, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
so good to me, I never know when to leave off. Here,
neighbour, will you give me my shawl off the bed, and
put it nicely over my shoulders, then pin it underneath
the collar of my habit-shirt with this large pin, and then
we will set off, for it will take us some time to select the
different things you wish to buy for the poor Morels."</p>

<p>Rodolph readily obeyed the directions of Rigolette.
First he took from the bed a large plaid shawl, which
he placed with all imaginable care on the well-formed
shoulders of Rigolette.</p>

<p>"That will do, neighbour. Now, lift up my collar,
and press the shawl and dress together; then stick in
the pin; but pray try not to prick me with it."</p>

<p>The prince executed the orders given with zealous
accuracy; then observed, smilingly, to the grisette:</p>

<p>"Ah, Mlle. Rigolette, I should not like to be your
<i>femme de chambre</i>; there is danger in it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered Rigolette gaily; "there is
great danger for me of having a pin run in by your
awkwardness. But now," added she, after they had left
the room, and carefully locked the door after them,
"take my key; it is so large, I always expect it will
burst my pocket; it is as large as a pistol," and
here the light-hearted girl laughed merrily at her own
conceit.</p>

<p>Rodolph accordingly "took charge" (that is the prescribed
form of speech) of an enormous key, which
might well have figured in one of those allegorical
devices in which the vanquished are represented as
humbly offering the keys of their lost cities to the
conquerors. Although Rodolph believed himself too
much changed by years to run any risk of being
recognised by Polidori, he still deemed it prudent to
draw up the collar of his paletot as he passed by
the door of the apartments belonging to the quack,
Bradamanti.</p>

<p>"Neighbour," said Rigolette, "don't forget to tell M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Pipelet that you are about to send in some things which
are to be carried at once up to your chamber."</p>

<p>"You are right, my good friend; let us step into the
porter's lodge for an instant."</p>

<p>M. Pipelet, with his everlasting bell-shaped hat on his
head, dressed, as usual, in the accustomed green coat,
and seated before a table covered with scraps of leather
and fragments of boots and shoes, was occupied in
fixing a new sole on a boot, his whole look and
manner impressed with the same deeply meditative air
which characterised his usual proceedings. Anastasie
was just then absent from the lodge.</p>

<p>"Well, M. Pipelet," said Rigolette, "I hope you will
be pleased to hear the good news. Thanks to my good
neighbour here, the poor Morels have got out of trouble.
La! when one thinks of that poor man being taken off
to prison&mdash;oh, those bailiffs have no hearts!"</p>

<p>"Nor manners either, mademoiselle," rejoined M.
Pipelet, in an angry tone, wrathfully brandishing the
boot then in progress of repair, and into which he had
inserted his left hand and arm. "No! I have no hesitation
in declaring, in the face of all mankind, that they
are a set of mannerless scoundrels. Why, taking advantage
of the darkness of our stairs, they actually carried
their indecent violence so far as to lay their audacious
fingers upon the waist of my wife. When I first heard
the cries of her insulted modesty, I could not restrain
myself, and, spite of all efforts to restrain myself, I
yielded to the natural impetuosity of my disposition.
Yes, I will frankly confess, my first impulse was to
remain perfectly motionless."</p>

<p>"But, I suppose, afterwards," said Rigolette, who had
much ado to preserve a serious air, "afterwards, M.
Pipelet, you pursued them, and bestowed the punishment
they so well deserved?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, mademoiselle," answered Pipelet, deliberately;
"when these shameless ruffians passed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
my lodge, my blood boiled, and I could not prevent
myself from hastily covering my face, that I might
not be shocked by the sight of these luxurious malefactors;
but, afterwards, I ceased to be astonished; for
well I knew I might expect some sight or sound to shock
my senses; full well I was prepared for some direful
misfortune ere the day had passed, for I dreamed last
night of Cabrion."</p>

<p>Rigolette smiled, while the heavy groans which broke
from the oppressed mind of the porter were mingled
with blows of his hammer, as he vigorously applied it to
the sole of the boot he was mending.</p>

<p>"You wisely chose the wisest part, my dear M.
Pipelet, that of despising offences, and holding it
beneath you to revenge them; but try to forget these
ill-conducted bailiffs, and oblige me by doing me a
great favour."</p>

<p>"Man is born to help his fellow man," drawled out
Pipelet, in a melancholy and sententious tone; "and he
is still further called upon so to do when a good and
worthy gentleman, moreover, a lodger in one's house, is
concerned."</p>

<p>"What I have to request of you is to carry up to
my apartments for me several things I am about to send
in, and which are for the Morels."</p>

<p>"Make yourself easy upon that point, monsieur,"
replied Pipelet. "I will faithfully perform your
wishes."</p>

<p>"And afterwards," said Rodolph, mournfully, "you
must obtain a priest to watch by a little girl the Morels
have lost in the night. Go and give the requisite notification
of the death, and bespeak a suitable funeral."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy, monsieur," replied Pipelet,
more gravely even than before; "directly my wife
returns, I will go to the mayor, the church, and the
<i>traiteur's</i>: to the church, for the soul of the dead; to
the <i>traiteur's</i>, for the body of the living," added M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Pipelet, philosophically and poetically. "Consider it
done in both cases; my good sir, consider it done."</p>

<p>At the entrance to the alley, Rodolph and Rigolette
encountered Anastasie returning from market with a
huge basket of provisions.</p>

<p>"That's right! That's right!" cried the porteress,
looking at the pair with a knowing and significant air;
"there you go, arm in arm already. To be sure, look
and love, love and look. Young people will be young
people, no doubt on't. Me and Alfred was just the
same. Whoever heard of a pretty girl without a
beau? So, go along, my dears, and make yourselves
happy while you can." Then, after gazing after them
some minutes, the old woman disappeared in the depths
of the alley, crying out, "Alfred, my old darling! Don't
worry yourself; 'Stasie's coming to bring you something
nice,&mdash;oh, so nice!"</p>
